# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the field of Artificial Intelligence that deals with text analysis and understanding. Some of the fields in which NLP is widely used are sentiment classification, spam detection and topic detection. Deep Learning is one of the tools that helps us solving NLP problems.

# Natural Language Generation (NLG)
NLG deals with writing language and turning stuructured data in text (whether written or oral).

# Transfer Learning 
As most deep learning models require huge amount of data to train well and that amount of data is not usually available, transfer learning is used.

1. The model is trained on large dataset (pre-training).
2. The pretrained model is adapted on your small dataset (fine-tuning).

## Activities planned
1. Presenting nlp2.pptx : 50 minutes
2. Essay writing Jupyter notebook interactive workshop (Essay_Writing/AI_EssayWriting.ipynb): 40 minutes
3. Chatbot Jupyter notebook interactive workshop (Conversational AI/chatbot.ipynb): 40 minutes
4. Transformer Jupyter notebook -- Just look into the final example (no need to go over each code chunk in detail): 20 minutes
