Natural Language Generation



## Chatbot
In this project you will have a conversation with AI. This is similar to something you might have seen in many websites. The AI model is a response generation model trained on 147 MB multi turn dialogue from Reddit discussion thread. We are going to use the free GPU environment provided by Google in the form of [google colabratory](colab.research.google.com).

### Objective

The aim of the project is to introduce students with the latest technoligies in the field of language processing. This project also shows how the latest advancements in machine learning can be used in everyday activities. Students gain an intuition about natural language generation, transfer learning and fine tuning. They also learn about challenges for conversational AI as opposed to written text generation.


### Activities

1. Learning about NLG and transfer learning.

2- Load pretrained DialoGPT

3- Interact with your basic chat bot

4- Fine tune with your chosen dataset

5- Observe how the style has changed

6- Evaluate your chatbot
