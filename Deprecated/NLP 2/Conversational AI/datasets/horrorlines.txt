They'll get in! We'll all die!
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
They can't get in here!  You said it yourself they'll get in!
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
Stop!
I figure it's karma. You wronged me and you wronged your wife and you wronged your children so this is karma biting you on the ass or in your case...  ...on the eye.
Spare me.
It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
I don't know I just got here. Did you find your girl?
Where is everyone?
Sorry didn't mean to scare you.
We're going to get my little girl.
Where are you two going?
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
We'll meet in three hours?
Um yeah thirty miles east.
You know where it is?
Oh come on! Can't you be happy for one split second? They're gone!
They'll be back.
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
He's right let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up grab the weapons.
We should go! We should go right now!
Don't be stupid drop the gun!
I will not die because of him!
I'm telling you I don't see a thing --
Careful.
Right.
We can't risk letting them in.
You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
With what just happened upstairs --
I don't think you should...
I got shells too box and a half tops.
I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs I think we got another rifle maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
But it's got teeth.
Well it don't look pretty.
Her fella.
My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
Nah I got the gun.
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
Yeah.
IS IT CLEAR?!
We're lucky to be alive.
We shot a skunk.
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
Stop it.
Anyone.
Who the hell would you call?
I have a CB in my truck we could get some help out here.
Gonna stay for a couple?
One keg of Beast for the basement then truck's dry.
You gotta be with me on this.
Well your last words can be "I told you so."
We'll be food dickheads!
If we move in a group we are one target. If we scatter they CAN'T get us all.
You got something better?
OPEN THE DOOR!
Wha?
"OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean?
Oh!
Come on come on.
Okay now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
Upstairs.
Where's that?
I think I know where a CB is.
C'mon guys--
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
Buddy I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.
You seem mighty collected about this.
Just move!
I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
Shit!
We just smeared a skunk.
In the corner behind the curtain.
Where's the tunnel?
Follow me.
You all sure about this?
This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front we're dead. We go out the back we're dead but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now who else is in? Seven can go.
What!? I'm not going down there again!
HEY! No I'm not trusting him either that's why you and I will both be going with him.
What's it for?
It's in the basement about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
What tunnel? Where?
There's a tunnel.
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
Easy.
Jesus Christ I'm gonna have a stroke.
Hey!
They're right here.
Well justice is funny.
No no no it was... it was wild out there no time to think we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
So your husband ditched you?
And the head?
And that's how I ended up here.
Unfortunately the worst of 'em are still outside.
And the rest of 'em?
That's the oldest of the bunch looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one Junior in the cooler there. As we've seen what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
Well why don't you keep your observations to yourself?
Just an observation.
That's an unwise thing to say you know that?
Look.
What?
Ohhh.
The door... on three.
I'd love to be macho but this is a pants wetter from all angles.
Of course not. I fight monsters all the time.
No. You?
Scared?
Get in line!
Fuck you too.
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
My truck.
What now Geronimo?
He's dead.
Come on!
Who's with me?
We're better off.
Believe me I'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch. But it's not in the cards partner.
Well then I guess we should just give up.
Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten you stay in here you get eaten anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here Spuds Makenzie?
Oh yeah?
I'm telling ya you got the cloth too deep you're asking for it.
Go douche.
You weren't helpin'.
Any more ideas Animal Planet?
Fuck no.
Why don't you go check it out?
So what now? Did those things leave?
We lived near power lines.
Your parents of relation?
Yep.
Your brother huh?
Look yeah he's an ass but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Why do you take shit from him?
Just cover me. It was built to move.
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
But not flush against the tunnel?
Yeah the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
Nothing this was my last delivery.
What's in the back?
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
Uh uh I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
All right!  Tell us about the truck!
What?
We gotta be close.
Anybody else?
We gotta try.
We're going to get help.
Anyone else?
I'm in.
Uh huh now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face I wanna do some appraising.
What? Really?
You don't understand sweety Daddy doesn't pay Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
How much you got to see the show?
How much I got what?
How much you got?
Sure.
You wanna see baby?
The girl's got rhythm.
Um-hmmm.
I can't feel a thing Hon.
Doesn't your foot hurt?
Okay then.
It's much safer in there sweety.
But --
Wait before you do that help me to the kitchen I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
Why not then?
No no it calms you makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer but in a fraction of the time.
Will I go crazy or something?
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
Really?
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
Oh no.
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
What is this?
Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
Oh.
Push and twist it's child proof.
Well...
How are you holding up?
I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
Let me make this clear; if we stay we die!
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
Keys.
Seven.
Nine?
Seven.
Max?
Holds four.
How many?
Covered.
Open?
Two.
Four door?
Fully.
Is it gassed up?
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away deliveries whatever.
What's it for!?
Nothing.
What's going on between you two?
Huh?
What do you mean what?
What?
What?
You're wasting your time there's no one out there.
Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point.
No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all unarmed.
In the kitchen under the sink.
Good.
The boards are solid oak planks and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this least nothing the size of the beasts.
Will these boards hold?
He shot you the other time.
Huh?
He only shot you once.
So your dead hubby shot me twice three of my customers have been eaten and there are angry creatures outside?
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast volatile predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
What?
He's dead.
Well where's the sonuvabitch!?
My husband...
What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down Cocoon.
I'll go with ya.
They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
I wouldn't do that son.
I think that's for bears and sharks chunky chew.
Sit still look less like a meal.
Oh? And what's that?
You young'uns worry about weapons I'm thinkin' bout strategy.
Whoa!
This one will just stun ya but this one will put ya to sleep.
Get outta here.
What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
Clear!
Blow the goddamn hatch!
What the hell's going on here!?
Clever fuckers.
No bullshit.
Bullshit.
Hey when this plan completely goes to shit what are ya gonna do?
Look the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group. Those that can shoot protect the rest to his ride.
You smell like ass!
They were all over the place.
F-f-fuck you.
Welcome back.
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant by the IGA on First. You all know where that is?
Where the hell are we going to go then Billy Jack!?
Get something on that.
Yeah maybe.
HELLLLLLLLP!!
COME ON!
MOVE YOUR ASS!
SHIT.
REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--!
Hurry!
If he doesn't shut up...
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
I'm fine! I'm fine!
Shit!
You keep that key handy.
Move it!
No shit.
Move slow and move quiet.
What?!
Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?
Well we are one miracle short tonight. So just guard the stairs?
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral.
What?
NO but I will lock you in.
Gimme the keys.
Fine Chief.
Duh hickey.
'Eh Chief?
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
Got 'cha!
HELLLPPP!
OH JESUS!
Don't worry you'll be like my little papoose.
Am I too heavy for you?
Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
Amazing you made it this far.
I'm in a wheelchair the truck sounds pretty good.
BONSAI!
HELP MEEE!
I'm sure.
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
You don't want the rag to touch the booze that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.
Let's move.
Ok. Let's see what happens.
Yeah I'll go.
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
Okay well... anybody else have an idea?
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So who's going into the basement with me?
Hey!
As long as it's dark they're around. They hide wait for you to drop your guard and then attack.
Well maybe they migrate?
They'll tear this place down within the hour.
Let's wait it out.
YOU'LL HIT US!
DON'T!
She's not very nice is she?
Let's go.
Nothing just lookin'.
What's wrong?
Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
GO-GO-GO!!
Get to your cars!
Go!!!
Not without you!!!
Go! Go!
Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there right?
If there is only one way out for us there is only one way in for them.
Wait God-dammit!
Let's go!
Whoa!
Hold it!
That's fine.
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
So we've got guns kitchen knives pipes fire and sticks.
Okay well that's something.
Father. The biggest the strongest...
And the last one is the...
If you are face to face with her dive left.
I think --
Did we make it?
I'd love to.
We should stick together out there.
Deal.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
I'll do anything to help.
She's still alive I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
Oh...
Her name is Charlie.
Right.
We all have to be strong right?
I admire your strength.
I'm fine I really am.
You know you don't have to do this.
All right.
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
Let's lock off this room.
Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never ever never let you go.
Stop her!
Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!
That's one piece of four problems.
Oh my God... What is that?
I just hit it like you said.
What have you done now broke the darn thing?
I said I'm not lying.
You know that no one likes a liar right?
I'm not lying.
What did we say about lying?
Well...
Are you lying to me?
Um well...
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
Um my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present sir.
Hey little bear aren't you going to join the others?
Maybe we should wait for Mr. Christy.
We should go now.
I will protect you.
The killer is still out there.
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
So young so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
No no they're all dead...
It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.
Jack? Marcie? Ned?
It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God oh my God... oh God...
Good night Brenda.
Good night Alice.
I guess...
Give them a little while longer. It's still early anyway.
I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.
I was careless.
Melvin Belli.
Right! Right!
Tomorrow is another day.
Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.
I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
What'd you see?
Sure.
I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up we can talk okay?
Thanks Alice.
Next Friday.
You may not care a lot about this place Alice but I mean to make it my whole life. It's been my whole life. Gimme a chance. Stay a week. Help get it ready. Next Friday if you're not happy I'll put you on the bus myself. I'll be grateful.
I don't know. Probably be best for everybody.
You want to leave?
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
Any particular reason?
Oh thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
You draw very well.
You told her to sweep the courts.
That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?
Push on this side. Alice this is Jack Marcie and Ned. Push.
Cabin B is ready.
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
Why don't we run? Just run now?
Wet. I don't know.
What's the matter with it?
No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
Hey guys!
Marcie?
Jack?
Okay.
I'll go check on Brenda.
They're off now.
Where?
Did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field?
I'll go take a look.
It sounded like Brenda.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
I don't hear it anymore.
Absolutely.
Help you clean up?
Well it hasn't been that long.
Good point.
It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.
Not if they're where I think they are.
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
Bad bulb or no power. It's getting a little gloomy in here.
Trouble?
Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
How the... did he get in there?
And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...
You can only do what you can do.
Almost five.
I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?
I don't know.
What'll you do when you leave here?
I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt but I thought I could stand anything.  I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife.
It still hurts?
Artist.
Filmmaker.
You're right. It makes no sense.
And it's this place. It makes no sense but it spooks me.
Maybe I can help?
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
How come you're leaving?
You okay?
Oh my God...
Un-hunh.
Steve said you were thinking of leaving. True?
I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
You think you're gonna last all summer?
Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. Annie.
Alice? The others show up?
I finished the boats.
Steve said for you to start on the boats.
You're welcome.
I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks Alice.
Sure.
Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment okay?
I'm sorry.
Don't burn that gorgeous body or I'll scratch your eyes out...
I'll be along.
Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
How come?
I need you so much Claudette.
Let's go back Barry...
Come on Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
Somebody's there Barry.
No they won't...
Somebody'll see.
Claudette...
Oh you...
I wouldn't know.
I can't Barry...
You know what I said though.
I meant everything.
You said we were special.
Where's Ned?
You just had some lucky shots.
I'll spot you five points.
Chance to get even?
Get behind him more.
Roll him over!
Is it stuck?
What is it?
A short somewhere.
Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.
I figured if I didn't save you. I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
Thanks.
I had to.
You saved my life.
Don't get up. Take a second...
I'll be okay. Holy shit...
Here we go.
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
For sure.
Give me a hand?
Where'd you get that stuff?
What the hell?
Ha! You wily oriental! The phone was "Mr. Watson come in here I need you." "What hath God wrought" was the telegraph.
That was the telephone.
What hath God wrought?
Whatever you make yourself.
No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?
We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp would we?
Holy shit...
Dancer.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
God but I love that sexy talk.
You ever fire one of those bows again and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
Want to see my trick shot? It's even better.
I don't believe you...
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
God but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires.
Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
Wait wait! When I was finding these goodies in the shed. I also found this letter which a camper never sent home. Listen.
It's gonna be a long summer.
Coach athletic director somewhere.
Jack?
Quote: Controlled substances are expressly forbidden. Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal. Unquote.
What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
Ow!
Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
Ha!
Gotta pee. You're lying on my bladder.
Whassamatta?
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
Umhummmmph.
Best over...
Mmmmmmmph.
Mmmmmmmph?
Just a little. Wait a minute woman.
Are you wet?
Lead the way!
This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?
I call it my shower dream.
It's just a dream.
You? The brick?
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
Looks like a storm.
I guess...
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do you know.
Don't call him.
Ned!
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
I don't love Neddy.
What about Neddy?
I love you.
I love you.
Makes me want to hold on and never let go.
Wind's up. It's shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.
Boy we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  Wait a minute I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.
Just a walk for Chrissakes.
Good call.
How about our last jay?
But it's in the brochure! "Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program." You just saw it.
Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens...
Those things can be nasty.
You okay?
Frankly Scarlet I don't give a damn!
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
Rocky Road.
Doctor. Now if you were a flavor of ice cream what would you be?
Okay Fireman.
Girls can't be cowboys.
Cowboy.
Yeah and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
It's beautiful...
There you are dead wrong.
Sex is all you ever think of Neddy.
For two lonely nights.
That's thirty percent.
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
...I know what you mean. Two and a quarter. Plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone.
I mean...
One night on the town.
How much do I owe you?
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.
Aw.
I got to.
You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
No thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
Anything else you want?
Yeah.
Another coincidence.
Good luck.
Sure.
Have to drop you here Steve.
You've made a science out of coincidence.
Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents more robberies more rapes more homicides more of everything when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts.
Why not?
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
I told you not to buy that hunk of junk!

After fifty years there ain't nothin' left but shoe leather.
You'd think on a ship this size there'd be something left to eat.
Lemme see was that before or after the oil fire?
The turbine blew.
Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.
When they find out what it's carrying they may not be so interested in what's legal.
Wrong. It's Friday.
I don't know. Tuesday?
What day is it?
You find anything that even looks like a compressor. I don't care what grab it.
I ain't no mechanic just so you know.
I need lag bolts especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium even tin'll do.
Yeah. Hell what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now gonna be Coastguard FBI who knows who all over the place.
Let's not be too hasty.
She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
Where's his boat then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself that's for damn sure.
We'll see who's dreamin' m'man.
Yeah but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
What's so great about Sweden?
Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
One minute I'm minding my own business the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
Morning skipper.
Damn mind of it's own.
Take it easy Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
Fucker!
Yeah a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship Dodge.
Lemme see.
That's what it says.
What? You sure?
Sixty pounds.
How about now?
Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
You think the extra strain caused it?
I don't care what ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size.
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
Hypothetically speaking what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back?
With that coxswain dickhead.
Looks like Epps' gonna get some tonight.
I'll sleep good tonight knowing that.
Hear that Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem.
Yeah yeah.
Get up.
What?
Dodge.  Dodge.
Why not?
What say Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
Did you?
Right. Wednesday.
Try Wednesday.
Then what the hell happened to him?
Other than the obvious there's nothing wrong with him that I can see not on the outside.
I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
A what?
I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
Oh yeah.
Smokes?
Seen a lota movies.
Pretty handy with that scatter gun Epps. You raised on a farm?
Maybe he isn't alone.
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
I'm saying we gotta do whatever we gotta do to preserve our interest.
So we kill him?
Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?
Gimme a break.
Maybe that is his boat.
I'm telling you I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
Light in those passages ain't so good.
I like my job.
What're you crazy?
Guess I'll just keep working.
I tell you one thing we're not gonna be towing no ship now.
What other choices have we got?
Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn!
This's gonna hurt a little.
Or uninvited guests.
Last thing we want is extra partners.
Yeah well how the hell you get something like that wrong? That's a damn big boat. It's either sunk or it ain't.
If this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago we just hit the jackpot.
Ever heard of insurance big boy?
Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
Bring it on dude.
Ready?
Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions?
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?
Somebody's probably looking for her as we speak.
Out here? What so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
Probably slipped her moorings got tangled up in a current.
No.
You think that's funny
Yeah.
Roger?
Roger.
Maureen?
Maureen.
What?
Maureen.
It just occurred to me I don't know your first name. All this time and I don't know it.
What?
What is your first name?
Why not.
One more?
Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem.
Where from?
Right.
Don't fall asleep.
Sorry.
You're late.
There's a charming thought.
Tomorrow we'll see if we can't find some line and tackle. Use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
Right.
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
Then you're a lucky man.
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
If money can buy what he wants.
That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
What the hell happened!
You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time!
Yeah.
Look I didn't touch it. Alright?
Conveniently enough for you.
I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat skipper?
I didn't touch the fucking radio.
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
What the fuck -- ?
Don't lie to me!
What?!
You smashed it!
Take it easy willya? What about the radio?!
The radio. Oh yeah the radio.
The radio!
Maybe you can tell me then.
I think you know.
I don't know what you're talking about?
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
With all due respect skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides it'll be safer where it is.
For starters getting that gold off the ship. What they don't know about isn't gonna bother them.
What do you propose?
Yeah well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved that's a whole new deal.
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
Well they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
How do you mean?
So. I got a question. Just from a you know purely technical standpoint. We call the Coastguard.  Coastguard shows up. What exactly is the plan?
If they knew what they were carrying.
On a passenger ship in 1953?
Not me.
It was a man's voice. Repeating some sort of children's rhyme. I don't know it didn't make any sense. You didn't hear it?
I think you better see this for yourself.
What is it?
You better get down here quick skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
Murphy.
Dodge to Murphy.
Right.
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
Can't you use something else?
So whoever did this might still be around.
That'd be my guess.
Could be meant as a warning.
Damn barbaric is what it is.
Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
Bodies're too fresh.
Yeah reconsider fucking his shit up.
If he's reasonable maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.
We'll stand a watch. Four on eight off. Low man first.
What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
Why not? Why the fuck not?
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
Not in the eyes of the law.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
If somebody's aboard her already she ain't ours. She's theirs.
Warm water current maybe making the metal expand.
Sounds like the hull.
Yeah yeah.
Dreamin's all any of you're gonna be doing if we don't get this boat running.
How about you Epps?
I'm buyin' me a nice outrigger. Spend my time hauling rich Seattle business men through the Puget.
The sooner we get under way the sooner we are to spending what's ours.
Yeah yeah. I'm on it.
So we get a little more for the boat. Besides the gold'll be safer where it is.
You gotta be kidding? What the hell we need that tub for we got fifty million bucks?
It looks like it.
Then we're rich. We're damn filthy stinking rich.
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
So what're we gonna do. That's the big question right?
Either way they must've had a pretty good reason.
Or somebody stopped them.
Then it happened before they scuttled her.
Didn't happen yesterday I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
A ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard adrift? And nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it?
What you think there's something funny about it?
It's a hell of a lot of money.
She take a radio?
Went aboard.
Man it gives me the creeps. We got no business towing a ship that size anyway. I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway.
Obviously it's some kind of screw up. The shipping records aren't a hundred percent accurate.
What do you want me to tell you that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it skipper.
Goddamit Dodge.
Three four days.
How long?
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
How long then?
It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
What about running number two by itself?
I'm telling you you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
We gotta get outa here Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
Hard to say.
But how long?
The right way and the wrong way.
I know I know two ways to do anything --
Like I always say --
How much longer's that gonna take?
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
I thought you said it was just a blade.
Turbine rotor's shot.
What's this?
Hard to say. I gotta get in there and have a look. At least a couple days. Depending.
How long to fix?
The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs but it's way underpowered.
Threw a turbine blade.
What is it?
Mother fucker!
Sounds reasonable.
With a little extra fuel weather permitting we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.
The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull.
It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size.
It's a risk I'm willing to take.
If you get it back in one piece.
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
Yeah from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.
Smugglers maybe.
What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.
Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
You aren't jealous are you Dodge?
I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
What?
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
You okay?
Better than starving to death.
I don't even want to know what that's gonna taste like now.
I feel fine.
Sudden flashes of light.
Lights?
Headache nausea lights?
No.
Any dizziness?
Because of the gold.
Stay away. Or else.
You're a pal.
Coffee.
Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there.
What'd he look like?
Hell yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.
That's a good thing?
Hell yeah.
That's what I call a payday.
Two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
Probably didn't have time.
Then why didn't they take it.
Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
You mean before she sank.
He'd let you off at the nearest port that's for sure.
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
Too big. More like a freighter.
Could be a fishing boat.
I bet you did.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night did you Epps?
Morning everybody.
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
What's slow?
I wish I could believe that. Either way you know what I've done. I've got no choice.
I don't give a damn about the gold.
I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to pure and simple.
It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
I think I see it pretty well.
Murphy don't you see what's happening?
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
And now you're gonna kill me is that it?
The way I figure it it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
So you killed them?
It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too except he went nuts. Couldn't take it I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.
You killed them.
Greer's gone. He broke out of the tank.
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
What?
We hit land.
What happened?
It's not the weather I'm worried about. The wrong current could drag us as far as the Aleutians before we come across another boat.
If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
Hard to say which is worse staying here or taking our chances in open water.
Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
They went crazy.
Maybe it was more than that.
Over the gold.
Could be a stroke. Who knows?  The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs."
What do you think?
Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on nobody comes down here.
What do we do with him?
Right here.
Epps? You there?
He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
Nope.
Either of you seen Dodge?
Epps over.
Murphy to Epps.
Just lucky I guess.
Why you? How come the rest of us haven't seen these people?
I don't know.
What's that supposed to mean?
She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't we might never leave.
More than just a mutiny. More than just the gold.
That much I think we've already established.
Something bad happened here Murphy.
Victims of what?
No. I think they are were just passengers. Innocent victims.
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
What happened.
Showing you what?
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
I don't know what else you'd call her. One second she was there the next she was gone.
What like some kind of ghost?
No. Someone else. A girl.  I'm not sure she was... real.
Not our mystery guest again.
When you found me yesterday at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.
I don't know are we?
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But judging by our Greek friends down below it doesn't look like the last time.
The what?
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question isn't it?
What do you think happened on this boat?
Wish I could say the same.
Couldn't sleep.
Hey.
Hey.
Doesn't matter.
It's not gonna hold us.
Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
If it was a ship she hit.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
But where's the damage?
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
Collision? With what?
"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made."
Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
The same day she supposedly went down.
February first.
"The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill."
But who -- ?
Smashed it up pretty bad.
Somebody took it out of commission last night.
What?
The ah... the radio's out.
Only something must've gone wrong.
If they were close enough to shore they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
No. I'll try again later.
Same. Any luck?
How's he doing?
I'll call us in. Dodge see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  Keep an eye on him.
He needs a doctor.
I don't know. No. Not Greer. Somebody.
Greer?
Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.
Yeah. Just a bird. Just a stupid bird.
You just shoot at something?
Epps.
Murphy to Epps.
Yup.
Got your light?
No cowboy shit. Right.
No cowboy shit up there understand?
Dodge get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?
Guess that'd be me. Again.
We don't exactly have the best bargaining position.
So we find this guy and make a deal with him.
It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
You sure it wasn't me?
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
Are you sure?
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
What? What the hell're you talking about.
There's somebody else on this boat.
What guy?
The guy. He just came this way.
Who?
Did you see him?
Take it easy you'll live longer.
For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
Why not call for help?
Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
Only way to be.
You're more practical than superstitious.
I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.
You think she's sailing without a crew?
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
So what did happen?
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding they found her completely deserted. The captain his wife their daughter and the entire crew all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
Nope.
Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
Well suppose she got a little further north than she should have.  Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack which moved further north where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her.
Her destination was Halifax yeah.
She was sailing up north right?
Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
What'd you find up there?
Yeah. Thanks.
Coffee?
They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it let them try.
Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
Go on.
It's my pen name.
Candy?
Fine with me.
Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board we'll know about it.  You can do what you want Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
All I'm saying is that gold's worth a lot more to us now than it ever was.
You think whoever did this is reasonable?
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
Leave it.
What about the gold?
Doesn't look like it much matters.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
Can't find the shotgun.
Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
He took the shotgun and a light.
The mooring hasn't come taught.
We're still drifting.
Government weather. It's got a transmitter aboard.
A what?
It's a Noaa buoy.
Must be a little too the truth eh Dodge?
Shut up.
Gettin' a little hot under the collar I'd say.
The coast guard has our last position. They'll send somebody out soon enough. A ship this size you can't exactly miss.
We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either.
Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off!
We're not gonna be able to pump it!
I wish I could tell you. I'd be real interested to know myself.
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
Oh man.
Dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
Say what?
You've been out for about a day.
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
You don't remember?
What happened?
Lost my sea legs.
How're you feeling?
Drink up then.
Never been more thirsty in my life.
Maybe.
Maybe Epps's mystery man had something to do with it.
And look what happened.
Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.
Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
Ho-ly shit.
We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship but it's probably worth looking around.
Pretty low all around.
Would you hold on just a minute here please? Look there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat.  Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool nobody'll be the wiser.  The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
I say we off-load some of that gold now.
Supposing he wants to get bad with us?
Let's just take it easy here alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
I don't know.
Moving to Sweden.
Greer?
Not much at all I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.
Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece.  What you gonna do with your share skipper?
And get a bunch of fools sniffin' around here?
We could call for help.
What now?
Dodge you gotta get on those repairs.
I heard that.
It's worth the effort. Believe me. Besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.
Yeah but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to Sitka.
We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold they come looking for.
If they thought it was lost at sea they probably just wrote it off.
Ho baby!
Hard to say. Maybe forty fifty million.
How much you figure that's worth skipper?
Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. Where's Epps?
You're up late.
Morning.
Yeah.
Some classy tub in it's day huh?
So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
We've done it before.
You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
Whatever the reason she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage her.
Sorry.
Murphy goddamit.
Besides a little rust everything's pretty well-preserved.
How's that?
It's funny.
Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out.
Call the Coastguard?
Looks like it's adrift.
Too deep to anchor out there.
Alright. I'll be right up.
I been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn't moved. I can't raise it on the radio either. Makes me think it might be in trouble.
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
Yeah.
Red sky in morning sailor take warning.
Red sky at night sailor's delight.
Better than "making hamburger for Mickey D."
You got that right.
I must be in the wrong business.
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
What do you say Dodge?
Let the buyer beware.
Of course they did.
The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka.
Go.
Greer to Murphy.
Or what?
You got about two seconds to get your paws off me Tarzan.
These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it.
I heard you. But I'm choosing to ignore you. Epps let's go.
Didn't you hear me grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down?
As I said what seems to be the trouble?
Whyn't you mind your own business chief.
What seems to be the trouble ladies?
You want fair pay make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise please to sign.
You're kidding right?
Twenty. You knock off twenty and then we see. After my guy looks at it.
Fifteen at the most.
That cost me twenty grand at least.
You pump it out and re-seam the hull she'll be good as new.
No no. You got leak.
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
What's this?
Better late than never.
I thought you say Tuesday.
Please don't kill us please don't kill us.
Please don't kill us please don't kill us.
Yeah it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
I agree.
Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.
The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... I think they ate his face off tore open his rib cage pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene.
Cool.
Oh I know. I'll show you where it's at sweetie. Aren't you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love.
I know I hate Swiss cheese the holes make me nervous.
I always hate saying the word cheese every time you get your picture taken... smile say cheese.
Any cone yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly I don't like crumple either.
Huh... what cone?
Cone.
What?
Maybe maybe maybe... hey you know what word I hate?
Deadwood is that what it's called? Cool will you show us?
Yeah it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
Really wow so it's really a real thing.
Yeah I know where that is it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can show ya.
Yeah icky. This one guy stops and I look in and he's got his thing out waving it around like a drunk monkey.
Yikes.
Yeah most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Really that's a long time.
Whoa thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.
Yeah I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.
Take his gag out it's more fun with the screaming.
Who's your Daddy!
Who's your Daddy!
Oh he's coming he got something real special this year.
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Drink up it's party time.
No I told you...
Come on ma... this bitch's got it coming.
Baby! Stop!
I'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.
Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
Ma Tiny's in.
Oh he was already gone before I seen him... but Tiny saw him and said he said he was going out to the yard to get a new wheel.
What about R.J.?
Tiny's home.
Whoopie fucking doo.
Hey great they're back.
OK sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.
That's not something to joke about.
Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
What? No I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.
Don't worry sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
Mmmmm this is tasty.
A dead one.
Hey um...  ...what kind of animal is that?
You're welcome.
Thank you.
You sure do a lot of guessing.
Um yeah sure I guess.
No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot now... do you want marshmallows?
So you live here alone... I mean with just your brother?
Yeah come on.
He left!
Oh... yeah he already left. We'll wait inside come on.
Is your brother ready to go?
Aw you ain't seen nothing yet.
Christ you scared the shit out of me.
OK.
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
Well yeah kind of.
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
How much further?
Come on.
Don't worry I'll be right back.
OK.
OK whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck faster we get out of here.
If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.
Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there.
Which way?
Oh yeah the tree.
What about the tree?
Couple more miles up this road.
Where's that?
Aw I was going home to my Mamma's house... yeah I was out doing this thing.
Yeah I'll do something.
Why? You gonna do something about it?
You shouldn't a done that.
Take that you fucking slut!  Fucking redneck whore!
Fucking great.
He walks duh.
Oh wonderful.  Fucking psycho.
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
What the hell are you laughing about?
I was just wondering cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.
Do you believe this fucking girl?
You know... a couple of queers.
What?
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
Wondering what?
I was just wondering.
Can I help you with something?
Nice.
I'd like to see that.
The animals have got nothing to do with it.
No! He's one of God's creatures he can't help it if he's dumb... I'm just crazy about animals.
A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her she just up and disappeared some day... real weird.
What's this?
Hey wait take this.
Come on bro. Let's go.
Holy crap thanks!
Keep the change and get yourself a new name.
Ummmm... two hundred and eighty-five dollars.
Great story Goober how much?
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober but the guys drew in the other O fucking assholes.
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
Yeah yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
Yeah well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit you know what I mean?
You all sure are buying a lot of holy water for two people.
Now what makes you think that?
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
Well fuck me Side Sally who want to read about all that horse shit anyway.
No no I think it's really interesting.
Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits I'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
But suppose for a second you did.
I don't.
But if you did.
I don't drive cross country.
You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. You know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.
I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
Yeah I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
Hell boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.
You mean John Wayne?
Yeah my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
The Duke?
Shit I don't remember exactly. I took over for my Pa just after the Duke nabbed the Oscar.
No really.
How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long that's how long.
How long have you been running this place?
Jesus you think she was really gonna cut you?
Almost there.
I know this is fucking nuts.
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
Tasted pretty good.
Didn't look like chicken to me more like fried pussy cat.
Hey I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
Whatever at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
Oh don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right Bill?
No problem.
Thanks.
Don't forget the flashlight it's pretty dark out there.
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us man. There's no saving it now.
You're a real fucking piece of work.
Well technically I did what ya said.
Jesus Christ Jerry.
Yeah I fixed it. Well I ain't... um I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
I hope you fixed the spare like I asked ya.
Gee ya think it wouldn't be too much trouble.
I'll help ya.
OK let's relax. I'll check it maybe I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out just yet.
Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
What was that?
No... yeah they ripped him to pieces while his family watched from the car. The wife is screaming the kids are crying. Some dude in another car filmed the whole thing.
Oh yeah I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.
That reminds me of a film I saw once of a guy who got out of his car at Lion Country Safari to take a picture of a lion cub and got eaten by the lions.
Cat fight cat fight.
She looks like she stinks.
Way out here?
It's a hitchhiker.
What's that?
Come on we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.
I don't know.
I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
How much further?
Keep straight on this road here.
Hell yeah.
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
Really fucking awesome.
How awesome?
Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome.
OK Boss.
I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see if it's worth thinking about.
I hope this place is cool. We could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12.
Perfect.
Don't panic yourself way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.
I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction man.
Yeah no shit I just told ya.  Hey you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says "Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."
Oh yeah I remember now.
Then the devil says "are you gay?" Guy says "fuck no"... Devil says "Well then I guess you're gonna hate Thursdays."
Yeah.
Then the devil asks "do you drink?" Guy says "yeah"... devil say "wonderful Wednesday is free drinks night best booze you ever had... all made from the finest stuff."
Shit we really need to find some gas.
So the guy goes to Hell and the devil says "do you smoke?" The guy say "yeah"... the devil say "great cause Tuesday is cigar night sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had."
Hold on I've heard this before... but I can't remember the end.
Hot has got nothing to do with it.
Yeah I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
Dude talk about baggage that ain't no carry-on shit that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
I'll let it slide she was only seventeen.
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
Fuck yeah she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing so that baggage ain't hanging around.
Oh yeah I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
Yeah no shit.
If we're talking cute... like regular cute I'd say Leslie Van Houton but cute ain't hot.
Better than pissing... anyway so what's your choice?
There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude Jeff Baxter he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
Yeah but she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit what did we call her?  Oh yeah Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
She's pretty cute.
Sqeaky! No way she ain't that hot.
Really? Huh I thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme. She's got that snooty vibe I know you dig.
Lock the fucking doors.
Don't look back just get in the car.
I suppose. I mean they're obviously all bonkers but I guess they're harmless.
Yeah I'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out. There's nothing else.
Man it's already ten thirty.
Shit I'm all for being a sport but this is ridiculous.
That food...  ugh I feel like I'm gonna puke.
Just grin and bear it.
Yeah showtime for what?
What's he so excited about?
I mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles.
Yeah maybe R.J. could just tow us and our car to the nearest garage.
Turn that fucking radio off!
Fuck! We are fucked!
He won't move.
Honk at him. Scare him.
Here he comes.
I like sleep.
It won't work.
Drive through it!
I gotta open the gate.
What are you doing!
Oh I'm sorry bothering you? Was I disturbing your viewing pleasure?
Quiet.
How much is a person supposed to stand?
Just sit back and enjoy the show.
This is starting to make me real uncomfortable.
Well ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
Check this out.
Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
Don't worry I'll be quick. Just stay here no sense everybody getting drenched.
Screw that no way I ain't letting you go by yourself.
Forget it. I'll just go.
Fine! I'll go straight!
What!
Fine. I'll go straight.
What?
Well I got some bad news and some bad news.
Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.
Hey he moved.
Then run him over he'll move.
There's not enough room.
Go around him.
There's a dog in the road.
Why are we stopping?
Where ya headed?
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
She looks like a freak.
We can't leave her out here in the rain... maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
Should we stop?
It's a girl.
Well don't even think about playing the good samaritan there's way too many psychos wandering loose these days.
Alright alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
Enough talk write.
Yeah yeah sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
How's about you give me those same directions.
Yeah they weren't here but a few minutes didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as I do with most of the assholes that wander through here.
Is that all... think real hard.
And I gave 'em directions out there up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
And...
Aw she was with some nosey smartass high-rise kids. They were poking around... asking stupid questions.
What'd you see who was she with where were they going?
Hmmmmmmmmm?
Come on get with the facts.
You seen this girl? Say... within the last 24 hours.
Well I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business if ya get what I'm saying.
What I need are some answers. 
Officers officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about.
Yeah I remember Mr. Alacard the shop teacher use'ta call you Little Dick Wick. Hey wasn't there a song we made up to go with that?
Fuck your grandmother.
I hear ya.
Ya hear me? You bust that crapper and I'll beat your ass.
Can I get some stamps off ya?  Did you fix the toilet yet?
Yeah now there's the perfect woman.
Nova yeah she looked pretty sweet.
I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt couldn't get it out.
Goddamn.
Naw he don't do anything else with 'em but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
Yeah doesn't hurt himself just spins it around next to his eyeball.
What?
Yeah I guess you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
Well yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges shit the guy's like forty or something.
Christ ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.
That kid is one horny retard.
Fascinating.
Yeah he's all hot on her after he found some of his dad's old nudie books hidden in the basement. He keeps 'em taped inside his school workbook.
The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
Shit this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb.
Hmmmmm.
I... I got back a stack today. Some nice shots.  See a good topless June Wilkinson... unfortunately she personalized it...  to Stucky love June.
He tried to burn the house down said it was possessed by the spirits. Tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started. I don't think Earl ever meant to harm us... but Tiny was badly burnt his ears were destroyed and most of his skin.
What happened? Oh I'm sorry it's none of my business.
Yeah my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
Oh.
You'll have to forgive Tiny he can't hear so much.
No dear I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
You sure you don't need any help in there?
How's he get around out here?
Tiny ain't got no car he ain't even got a bicycle.
He should be back in a couple hours.
How long is that gonna take?
Yeah I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters.
That's nice.
No he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house...  ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down.
No none. I had one once back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.
Huh? Oh hi. You really don't have a phone?
Help help us.
Someone is out there...  ...help we're in here!
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
That was good babe just keep doing that.
I know but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
Think think. Try to open the lid try to kick a hole in the wood.
We've got get out of here we got get out of here.
Shhhhhh.
You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted.
This isn't funny it's twisted.
I don't know I think he's funny.
What are you laughing at?
Shhhhhh.
Hey I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
Really now is not the time to make waves.
Yes thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Dude your chick's a little high strung.
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
Hey nice outfit Billy Bob.
When you were outside with Bill.
When?
Yeah Jerry she said some pretty fucked shit to us.
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
You know what Jerry who really cares at this point?
I don't know I just thought it was interesting.
So what?
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
Yeah?
Blah blah blah... it doesn't say but she was released sometime in 1937 only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan the arm-less wonder. Says she "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
Why?
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
So.
It says "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
Yeah so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
Yeah in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
Oh yeah.
Hey listen to this... I think this is related to our Dr. Satan.
Fuck it's freezing.
That seems likely.
Hey maybe she knows where this is?
Fried chicken.  Anybody want some?
Ugh what's that smell?
Oh yeah murder museum... sounds fun.
Aw come on. It will be fun.
I don't want to see that.
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
Tickets for what?
Great you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
Grab Mary and come inside.
Huh?
Well just promise me you'll be careful... alright alright see ya soon... good-bye.
Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes Dad I'm kidding.
Well don't take too long the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
Yeah well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies you know Jerry... yeah he's gotta see everything... yeah I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
Oh yeah yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.
No nothing like that... yeah we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing so we're kind of behind schedule.
Hello...  ...hey Denise... what what's wrong did you break down?
Yeah it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place.
Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
A couple hours!
Bill why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
Excuse me may I please use your phone?
I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
Jesus Christ.
Turn on the headlights. See if anything is out there.
I still don't.
Shhhhhh quiet.
I don't hear anything.
Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio.
What? I didn't hear anything.
What was that?
I don't know... about half an hour.
How long has it been?
Yeah she said we looked queer.
She said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that.
I can't believe...
I think I'm going fucking crazy.
God damn it I knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit.
You got to be fucking joking.
Don't even say it.
She looks like she stinks.
Stick her in the front if you want to pick her up so bad. She's soaked.
Aw Christ Jerry. We can't see anything now it's too dark. Let's forget it.
Let's just skip it. It is probably nothing anyway.
Maybe he's a cyborg.
Never. I swear to God he never sleeps he goes to bed after me wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
Geez he never gets tired does he.
Exactly... well I guess a couple more photos won't kill me.
Scattered smothered and covered.
If I never eat at another Waffle House again I can die a happy girl.
A decent meal every once in a while wouldn't hurt either this road food is crap.
I know that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
Yeah I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
It will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate. This trip is fun but it's starting to get brutal.
Yeah hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?
God I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh my back is killing me.
Tell me about it.
I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.
Aw shit...  I gotta pee anyway.
Aw it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
Christ I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
Too late. You're in for life let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
I resign.
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
No please let me sit this one out.
Rise and shine.
Sleeping.
Come on sleeping beauty time to go to work.
Yep I found something.
You find something Georgie?
God damn.
Yep I suppose it is.
That's the understatement of the year.
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Shit I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
Not yet.
Recover any bodies?
Yeah no mercy here.
Holy Jesus somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing.
A vehicle registered to a William S. Hudley.
What'd we here Georgie?
Yes sir.
Open up the trunk.
Huh?
Well Christ boy don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree.
Keys.
What'd ya got there?
Aw honey you know I can't do that.
Please let us go we won't tell anybody.
Bye sweety we could of been great together.
Great.
No no no it's so much more special than that... you'll see you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love.
Oh you mean on TV.
For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.
Firefly... mmmmm odd name. Mrs. Firefly do you know anything about the legend of Dr. Satan?
Firefly.
I've been meaning to ask you Mrs... Ummmm.
Didn't ya think Mary?
Maybe. He's a real lady killer.
Great. I thought I felt a certain attraction between Mary and Tiny soon as he walked in.
I was just kidding.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
I don't doubt that.
Oh really...  ...well I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
Well I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
So what brings you kids way out here ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
Um I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise and Mary.
What do they call you sweety?
Oh right.
His name is Rufus Rufus Jr. but we all call him R.J.
Hey maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
Negative. Shit we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
I'm with Denise can't we just walk to someplace this is getting fucking stupid.
I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit that's the words.
This is way too fucked up for words.
Enough with the stupid voices.
OK lassies I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
What!
Hold on hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.
You didn't see the look she threw me. She's up to something.
Oh don't blow everything out of proportion.
That stupid hillbilly slut.
Huh?
God damn it I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.
You said it not me.
I'll go. It's my fault.
I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way right?
Just back up.
Huh?
We hit the jackpot! Let's roll good buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.
Shit it is only sprinkling and it's worth the trouble. Hold on for two seconds.
Aw come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
I'm gonna go ask him.
Don't worry I'm gone.
I suggest you kids leave now.
Well even though I know it seems childish to you all. Tonight is Halloween eve and it special to us so you are all invited to stay for dinner.
Sorry.
I know you're my guests and welcome but I'd please advise you to keep from cussing while in my house thank you.
Oh really well I hope something changes your mind some day.
No just a little too old.
Oh I get it... I guess you think you're too good for the simple pleasures of Halloween.
You my dear worm feeder are about to become immortalized.
What are you doing?  ...no stop... please please.
Oh come now... we're all creatures of God and freaks in our own way...  ...but if you'll notice...  right here needs a little something heh?
Fuck you you fucking freak!
Oh it's real... as real as I want it to be mamma...  ...look see the magic in my brush strokes.
This can't be real this can't be real this can't be real.
Behold... The Fish-Boy!
Let's go see.
Where is he?
Well Bill... he's a good guy he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
Where's Bill?
Doing what? Messy up your day? Well fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
Why? Why are you doing this?
No I can't say that I ever seen 'em before...  ...he looks familiar is he on TV?
Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way?
Oh you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform.
Thank you.
Oh alright... I guess I can trust you... being a man of the law and all.
Please just a minute.
I um... no I don't think so...
Please could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something.
Well I... mmmmm... no I ain't seen her sorry.
I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here Denise Willis... have you seen her?
Questions? Well heck I'll tell you anything you want to know.
My name is Lt. Wydell I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Aw you ain't disturbing me but it kind of looks like rain don't ya think?
Excuse me I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
Well hello officer.
Well go get her.
That's true Otis... not that we're having a bad time but...
Wait I want to say good-bye.
Get in... now!
Yes! I'm the one who beats you when you're bad...
Who's your Daddy!
I'm the one who brings the devil's brandy... 
Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do.
What should I do?
I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here take this.
I don't know. I only saw one.
What! God damn how many?
Otis! Otis! Come quick there's cops outside.
I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs.
Grampa... watch the language.
Right.
Fuck go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.
Call Wydell.
Jesus Christ.
Shit... fuck procedure.
Tell it to my daughter.
I ain't got a warrant.
We gotta break it open.
Over here inside the smokehouse.
Yeah I hear it... where's it coming from?
Shhhh... you hear that?
Shit don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
Where we headed?
Turn up this road.
My Denise is a smart girl she wouldn't do anything stupid and her boyfriend he always seemed like a good kid.
No they couldn't somebody had to see something.
Christ four kids couldn't just disappear.
No not really. Good kid never been in any trouble.
Fit the profile?
Local girl Karen Murphy been missing for a couple months figured for a runaway.
George Willis...  ...any leads?
Hey.
I pray to God there is.
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
Christ you know it's crazy...  I lived through so many other people's nightmares you know. Always cool and calm but... but I never thought I'd be the one needing help ya know?
Her part in this I can't figure... but I will.
Oh yeah you know about that? Hmmm that's a strange one.
What about the body you found?
Dr. Satan?
Well all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
That's it?
Well we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.
I'm Wydell... this is Naish.
Yes sir.
Mr. Willis?
We found one.
Over.
Excuse me for a second.
Wydell.
Right...  ...come on.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
Let's hit the road sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
Don't worry we'll find her.
Anyway there's not much else out that way... so I figure maybe there's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms.
Yeah it's horseshit just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with.
That must be him.
I guess not.
Yeah well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
Sounds like a bad idea to me probally just get in the way.
Chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house. Guy's an ex-cop thinks he can help.
You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird.
Call the chief... We found 'em.
Plates match.
What.
Aw fuck.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
I always favored the Hulk.
You know his senses start tingling... when he was approaching danger and shit.
How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
You know your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know like in the comics.
Yeah...  ...huh what the hell are you talking about?
Your Spidey senses tingling.
I hope you're right but my guts are telling me different.
Boss the way I see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced.
Right.
Well let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
Mr. Gibbs organize a cleaning detail -- you and Cotton.  I want every inch of the Pearl spic-and- span and ship-shape!
Aye aye sir!
AnaMaria trim the mainsail!
They'll be anchored on the lee side.  Haul your wind and keep to the weather of the island --
How does he do that?
I will.
You'll get it back.  Or one better.
That boat is my livelihood!
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
My dory.  The Jolly Mon.  Where is it?
AnaMaria!  Have you seen Gibbs?  I need to put together --
You stole my boat.
He didn't waste it.
Hah.  Ten years you carried that pistol and you end up wasting your shot.
Quite boy or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where.
No!  You gave your word!
Eh?  You have my word then -- on the Good Book I do swear and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
You must swear by the Holy Bible.
And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
We got that part.  Anything else?
Elizabeth goes free!
Enough of that!  Name your terms.
You can't.  I can.
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
She.  Goes.  Free.
What's in your head boy?
Or you could surrender.
So what now Jack Sparrow?  Are we to be two immortals locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Just so you know Jack -- I don't think you're that clever.  I think you're a fool.  A mortal fool.
Aye for us there is.
There's ... another exit?
Men!  Are you up for it?
Now you can take care of the Dauntless right?
Aye.  See after you're done with the Royal Navy you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be with two lovely ships on your hands and what to do?  Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one and who's to argue?  The Dauntless a first- rate ship-of-line and with it you can rule the seas.  But if you're Captain of the Dauntless who's left for the Black Pearl?
That so?
The situation has changed.
I can't help wondering Jack why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that it didn't end well for you.
Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.
What're you suggesting?
You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is if you're mortal.
Because right about now the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.
Why don't I want to do this?
All right then.
No I really think I do.
That's fair.
You can go to your grave not knowing.
So how did you get off that island anyway?
The last time you do this you left me a pistol with one shot.
You'd best take a swim Jack.
Someone needs to cut these bonds then.
Now Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around and you can't hope for better.
It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship twice in one lifetime.  No good can come of it.
Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect of course.
I'll watch my back.
That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her Jack -- she's pretty enough she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
What -- you don't have the medallion?
You're playing this as close to the edge as any man I'll give you that.  We might just have to sign articles you and I.  Jack you're a pirate at heart that's certain.
See that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
Jack I don't trust you and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man you can lay to that.
Track you down and --
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
You're setting me up for a double cross you with the ship and me with nothing more than your word!
Wait as long as you like.
Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
You left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do?
I'll torture it out of you.
You see I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way a sort of curse.  Oh and there's the fact that you have no choice.
I'm supposed to ... trust you?
That's right.
That's your offer?  You sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl and all I have is a name?
You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
The Pearl?  Oh that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
No you won't.
Say the name or I slit your throat.
I know whose blood you need to end the curse.
No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.
Do you believe him?
I guess there is a reason to fret.
Turner blood doesn't flow pure in his veins.  Best play it safe and spill it all.
No reason to fret.  It's just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood.
By the powers you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
That's proper sir according to the code.
And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him and you!
Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
Now.  No don't kill him.
Now?
Will -- you can't trust him.
Agreed.  You have my word as a gentleman of fortune --
Aye.  And not a bit of it any use to us only hoarded.  But it will drive us no longer.
The curse drove you to gather this?
It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de Muerta.
It's a pirate medallion.
Do you not know what this is then?
Would that I could.
Then why aren't you eating?
Oh there would be no sense in killing you Miss Turner.
Now none of that.  Please dig in.
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
Maid or not it fits you.
It's you who invoked the parlay! Believe me Miss you'd best hand it over now ... or these be the last friendly words you'll hear!
Can I trust you?
No no nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
Of course.  I didn't steal it if that's what you mean.
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom perhaps?
Thank you sir.
You've got sand for a maid.
Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
You have a name missy?
Did you now?
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago when we made the crossing from England.
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
I'll drop it!
Very well.
I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  Means 'No.'
I want you to leave.  And never come back.
There was a lot of long words in there miss and we're not but humble pirates.  What is it you want?
Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
My apologies miss.  As you were saying before you were so rudely interrupted?
Well I am not going to stay hidden in some cabin or I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage!
That would hardly be proper.
Then I can wear men's clothing.
You may seclude yourself in my cabin.  I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard.
I know where your heart truly lies.
What?
Elizabeth I hereby withdraw my proposal.
Not as a condition -- a request.
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
Commodore I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
Commodore please!
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
No.  The pirates have taken Will --
He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
You're speaking up for him again?
Commodore you can't do that!
Elizabeth I'm relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons.  And behind his back this time.
Yes I'm all right I'm fine!  Go capture him.
On his heels!  Gillette bring a squad down from the fort!  Elizabeth are you --
One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness.
Commodore I must protest.  Pirate or not this man saved my life.
I'm a bit nervous myself --
I can't breathe.
I apologize if I seem forward -- but I must speak my mind.  This promotion confirms that I have accomplished the goals I set for myself in my career.  But it also casts into sharp relief that which I have not achieved.  The thing all men most require: a marriage to a fine woman.  You have become a fine woman Elizabeth.
Very good.
His name is Will Turner -- that's all I found out.
Did he speak?
Fetch a hook -- haul him out of there!
Boy overboard!
Man overboard!
Think again Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag or wears a pirate brand gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
About the day we met. Do you remember?
Elizabeth this is hardly appropriate --
Women in London must have learned to not breathe.
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
Difficult ... to say.
Or rather Commodore Norrington ... a fine gentleman don't you think?  He fancies you you know.
I knew it.
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.
Ceremony?
Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
Yes -- yes.
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
Yes father.
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth we will be landing in Port Royal soon and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
Actually I find it all fascinating.
He said you say that!  He also said if that be the case you'll be dining with the crew and you'll be naked.
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
You'll be dining with the Captain and he requests you wear this.
It would appear so do you.
If an adversary demands parlay you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
I know the code.
Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew you must take me to your Captain!
What?
-- but that was not a proper kiss.
It doesn't!
Elizabeth I think it doesn't matter that we are of a different class --
There.  And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss!
I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart.
I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us.
-- then we never would have met.
If I had known --
To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London for fear of Execution Dock.
Why would my father send this to me?
Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
I'm glad we got here in time.
At least once more Miss Swann. As always.
Will how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
I could never forget it Miss Swann.
What's your plan?
I have a plan.  If it succeeds then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
Exactly.
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
Nor did you I noticed.
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
Exactly.
You -- you burned up the island for a one-time chance at being spotted?
That signal is over a thousand feet high which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction.  The entire Royal Navy is out to sea looking for me -- do you think there is even a chance they could miss it?
One because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two --
Why?
Yes the rum is gone.
What are you doing?  You've burned our food the shade -- the rum!
To the Black Pearl.
To freedom.
We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
Ah well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
Jack it must be so terrible for you to be trapped here on this island all over again.
You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
When I get the Black Pearl back I'm going to teach it to the whole crew and we'll sing it all the time!
More to drink!
Well perhaps ... with a bit more to drink I might ...
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
That was before I met one of course.
Oh no ... it's silly.  Back in England we didn't know a thing about pirates really.  They seemed so romantic and daring --
I know a lot of songs about pirates but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
What?  What was that?  Something funny Miss Swann? Share please.
Drink up me hearties yo ho ...
Not when you can drink instead at least.
Don't be thinking I'm happy about this Elizabeth.  But I see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which I can do nothing about.
You're right.  Here's luck to you Will Turner.
A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!
You should look at our contretemps this way: we've got shade trees thank the Lord.  We've got some food on the trees thank the Lord again.  And we've got rum praise the Lord.  We can stay alive a month maybe more.  Keep a weather eye open for passing ships and our chances are fair.
Welcome to the Caribbean love.
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
Last time I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this they've been out of business and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
But ... you did it before!  Last time --
It won't.  It won't and so we won't.
What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
The trees are taller.
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind and fight them. You go on.
Come on!
No I'm -- rescuing you.
You're in league with Barbossa!
Me!
You?!
I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
You are despicable.
Miss Swann if you'll be so kind?
Miss Swann.
Ah that's a dark and unpleasant tale best left untold.
How did you get off the island?
We're catching up!
What's in your head to put you in such a fine mood?
She can hold a bit longer.
We'd best drop canvas sir!
That he is.
Kid's a bit of a stick isn't he?
And you've got that have you?
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
A fool's errand.
Aye and that's why I know where it's going to be and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.
Jack it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be and I'm going to take it.
Say again?
Now where I wonder would they have gotten that idea?
Oh there's a hard tale Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx.
First -- have you found me a crew?
Make it last then.  Now what's the nature of this venture of yours?
Aye that'll about do it.
Well fortunately I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
Curse you for breathing you slack- jawed idiot.  Mother's love Jack you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  It's bad luck!
Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth especially -- if we fight.
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
That we are.
We're not going to just surrender!
It's a signal.  If we resist it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.
How did he get off the island?
Jack gave hisself up for the sake of his loyal crew.  He was marooned on an island left there to die.
Ah -- he's learned then.  Plays things more close to the vest. See Jack was a cartographer back in Old England.  Somehow he came by the money to commission the Pearl. Hired himself a crew promised each man an equal share.  So they're forty days out and the First Mate says everything's an equal share that should mean the location of the island too.  So Jack gave up the bearings.  That night there was a mutiny.
What?  He never told me that.
I'll tell lee.  Now Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
Really?  So ... what's the story on the pistol?
Now lad just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta wherever it may lay.
How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?
I know.  That was for the smell.
Blast it I'm already awake!
I don't think that will be necessary.
Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
All the men in place sir.  Ready to fire.
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
We need only to come about to put them in range of the long nines.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway we'll never catch them.
Raise the sails.
As likely as not.  Will short up the anchor we've got ourselves a ship!
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm sir.
Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat so you can all get back to shore safe and sound.
Sir I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
We'll see about that.
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
Dead serious.
I said no lies.
None?  Very well.  You rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships pick up a crew in Tortuga and go on the account do a little honest pirating.
Smith.
What's your name?
That so?  I've heard of one supposed to be fast neigh uncatchable ... the Black Pearl?
Oh the Dauntless is the power in these waters true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
That's a fine goal I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
This must be some important boat.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
Some sort of to-do up at the fort eh?  You two weren't invited?
Sorry I didn't know.
This dock is off-limits to civilians.
I'll slip in talk them into to come out and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them.
I'll be at the wheel myself.
That chart I drew up'll get you past the reefs.  If you're steersman's good enough that is.
I knew you'd listen to reason!
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
You would do that?
Funny I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone and while you're setting up an ambush I'll trick the pirates out to you.
I don't like the situation Mister Sparrow.  The island is riddled with caves.  I will not put my men at a disadvantage.
By remembering that I serve others not only myself.
Norrington think about it ... the Black Pearl its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?
We are bound for Port Royal not Isla de Muerta.
We had time to get to know each other.
Indeed.
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
Ah but you have heard of me.
Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship.  You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.
Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
Well well... Jack Sparrow isn't it?
The worst.  On the other hand maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  Now that's a great pirate.
Well you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of.  You're a man who can be trusted who can be counted on and who can't betray his friends.  What kind of pirate is that?
-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
Jack!
It's the right way.
Are you certain this is the right way?
Don't talk.  These caves magnify sound.  Just follow me.
Jack!
Do you have any idea where you're going?
My name is Will Turner the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --
I'm sure.  When you've led the kind of life that I have there are debts that must be paid.  Maybe I can balance the scales a little.
Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
Go to the opposite end of the island and signal the ship.  I'll keep 'em busy.
I'll lead them away.
No.
This way!
Miss Swann!  We're here to rescue you!  It's going badly!
On whether the stories are all true.  If they are that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not --
On what?
Depends.
What's that?
Barbossa.
But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--
The pistol.  When a pirate is marooned Will he's given a pistol with a single shot.  No good for hunting or surviving really.  But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.
Wait -- what about the pistol?
These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them --
Shut up before you lose them all!
Don't worry.  I've already got a Quartermaster -- there!
Just do it quickly.
Oh -- did I forget to mention that?
Tortuga?
Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair is it?
You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight I'd kill you.
Put it away Will.  It's not worth getting beat again.
My father -- was not -- a pirate!
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life telling folk one thing and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law and followed the rules--
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
I swear you look just like him.
That's not true.
Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door it was like seeing his twin.
'Bootstrap?'
I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
My father.  William Turner?
Is that so?
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed I came out here ... looking for my father.
For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats you're a quick study.
Aye!  Avast!
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
This is either crazy or brilliant.
So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
It's still against the law.
Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?
No worries there.  She's far more likely to rot out from under us.
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
Come aboard.
Good.
I'd die for her.
My business Will.  As for your business -- one question or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
Why are brothering with that?
We need to go!
Not without my effects.
Agreed!
Agreed.
I helped build these cells.  Those are hook-and-ring hinges.  The proper application of strength the door'll lift free.  Just calls for the right lever and fulcrum ...
How?  The key's run off.
I can get you out of here.
So it is that you found a girl. Well if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart you'll have to do it alone.  I see no profit in it for me.
Never.  They took Miss Swann.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
Because you're a pirate.
Why ask me?
The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
Where does it make berth?
Somewhat.
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
Move!
No.
Move away.
Pirate.
You cheated.
You need to find yourself a girl.  Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her?
I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
Who makes all these?
Only a little.
You threatened Miss Swann.
Do you think this is wise boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?
Ah.  Then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record.  So if you'll excuse me ...
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before?
Still --
Mentioned it is more what he did.
That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.
If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
He may be.
He's not telling the truth.
I think he's telling the truth.
And no lies!
What's your business in Port Royal 'Mr. Smith'?
Like I said there's no real ship as can match -- Hey!
... no.
Oh and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?
But I've seen a ship with black sails.
No.
... No.
You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
Yes I have.
You haven't seen it.
Yes.
You've seen the Black Pearl?
Yes.
You've seen it?
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
No it's not.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
Dammit man it appears someone is stealing your ship!
Please.
But --
A moment.
Commodore --
Bleak.  Very bleak.
Well she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
No.  She hasn't.
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
What happened here?
Where did he come from?
He's still breathing.
My apologies Governor.
Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter.
No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
I am telling the truth.
Why don't you just come clean Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
Who?
But not everyone's imaginary are they Mr. Taransky?  I refer of course to Edith.
And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you talk so much about a renowned failure who also happens to be so conveniently dead -- perhaps the "man" you claim helped invent Simone is an invention himself?
Of course.
So of course you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
Oh no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud not murder.
-- Forgive me Mr. Taransky.  I'm just trying to understand.  All these films TV appearances magazine covers internet interviews publicity photos snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.  This is fake this is fake -- fake fake fake all fake.
Good-bye.
I'm glad we talked.
Thanks.  This is my exit so I --
Okay -- for you.
Christ --  Elaine I know how it looks but...  ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars. If you won't do it for him please do it for me.
Simone I recognize the shirt you're wearing.  I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
I don't know how many times I have to say this Elaine but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen Elaine Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different.
My God are you alright Simone?
I'm not --  He's not.
You don't have to protect my feelings Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
I want to reassure you Elaine there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
No I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this Simone but Viktor and I were married once.
I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm late.  I'm on my way to see Viktor now.
No... it's life.
Don't look so glum Viktor.  It's not a death sentence.
That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this Lainey?
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you we can really do things.
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
Don't thank us too fast Viktor. You know what we have to do?
Thank you!  I don't know how you did it but thank you.
How can you bring that up at a time like this?
Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?
No!  Whatever talent Simone has comes from me -- me!  Me!  I swear as God is my judge.  You don't know what I've been through.  Tens of thousands of mind-numbing hours in front of that screen nights without end and look what it's cost me.  Why do you think I've been wearing these?  I may have done irreparable harm to my eyesight and why?  To extract and refine the infinite nuances of a human being -- a human soul.  Don't you see?  I made Simone!
You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again?
-- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I Viktor Taransky have perpetrated the greatest hoax the greatest sleight-of-hand sleight-of-mouth sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me recognizes what I've done -- even you.
How much wine have you had?
Who says that -- ?  -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me Elaine.  Simone is thin air pixels molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --
-- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back.
-- No no I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
Every actor is an invention Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it but it's not the finder who sparkles.
I'm going to tell you a secret now Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her.
You?
Not if I don't let her.
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
No.  She'll never work again -- retire never make a movie or a record or appear ever again.
But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party on some magazine cover some song on the radio up on some screen.
No I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
Oh Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here alone like this.  But in the morning you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?
No there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
That's sweet Viktor but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but for some reason I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?
I want you back too Viktor.
-- She already is.  Simone's not coming over Elaine.  Not tonight not ever.  I want you back Elaine.
-- And she was positively glowing at the awards.  I should be going she'll be here soon --
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
I just read somewhere --
Impossible.
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
Not quite.
Is Simone back to earth yet?
I suppose I could stay just until she arrives.
About now.  Would you like a drink?
When is she coming over?
As a matter-of-fact I am.
Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?
Elaine it's Wednesday.
I can imagine.
She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
... Simone.
Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
My two favorite girls.
It's a crowded summer.  We need every photo-opp sound-byte and column inch we can get.  Good night Viktor.
Excuse me?  Start?
Yes you do...  Anyway tonight was a good start.
I do?
Whenever I compliment Simone you take the credit.
Do what?
Viktor do you realize you always do that?
Thank you.
Well yes.  From a studio point of view it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent well informed a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular.
No of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?
Are you and Simone...  ... getting married?
No.
-- Viktor are you with her?  Is she there?
Oh yes.  Of course.  Don't I always?
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
Elaine what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
Really?
She said you were very beautiful.
She was there.  She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
I'll try.  Maybe live but remote. She'll never go to them.
Oh make it live -- please Viktor.
I'll tell you what.  I know how much this means to you.  I'll try to get her to plug the film.  I'm not promising anything but maybe she'll do a talk show -- taped.
You're so good to protect her like this.
She doesn't want pity.
Viktor you should have said something.
The premiere was the first time I've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.
-- I don't think that's necessary. I think it's perfectly clear.  I should have guessed -- it all makes sense now... it's why she never goes anywhere never seen in public...
-- I can explain.
So the secret's finally out Viktor.
Not now.  She's emotional.  Her mother dies today.  Scene forty-two of "Good For Nothing".  It's not a good time.
-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you Viktor.  If you can't handle her I will.
-- We have to talk to her Viktor!
-- You can't go in there!
That's true.
Everyone you know is lying.
Everyone I know has met her Viktor.
Soon.  Soon.
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
You really think so?
I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
Better late than never.
Maybe you're right.  Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
Who else?  It's always Simone's idea.
That's genius Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
I got them to remove the reflection.  The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.
Thank you.  What did you think Lainey?
Stunning Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
Viktor I have a feeling.  One of my feelings.  There's something about her I don't trust.
Simone does not control my destiny.
Experience Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
Elaine talking to you now not as Viktor director but Viktor ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
Listen Viktor... I want to talk to you now not as Elaine studio head but Elaine ex-wife.  Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.  We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
I'll walk you out.
Not today.  She's learning her lines.  You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.
Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
As I've tried to explain to you Elaine.  Simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. She's about the work and only the work -- lives for the work.  She wants all the money up there...  ... on the screen where it belongs. She'd work for scale except I know you only respect people you pay a fortune.
Well shoot it on the last day.
Even the fall from the plane.
Even the fall from the plane?
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
There isn't one.
What about it?
Well we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
I'll send you her resume.
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
Hair and make-up?
She'll drive herself.
Well something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic.  You allowed nothing for limousine service.
If it's on the page...
Really?  Oh so she's really going to do all this nudity?
There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... "instrument".
Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
"Forever".
Viktor we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."
Why not?
No problem.  Do you want to come in?
Sorry I didn't get her back in time.
She's my actor.  There are other studios Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
Viktor it's my studio.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
As I say she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
Why not?
I don't know if that's going to happen.
I can't wait to meet her.
Almost right.
I don't have it on me.  Anyway it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda the body of Sophia Loren the grace of well Grace Kelley and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private.
Why isn't she with you?
Good to see you too Elaine.
Where is she?
Even if you find her you know the problem with unknowns Viktor.  If they're good they get known.  And then you're back to sorting their candy... and worse.  I'm sorry Viktor.
I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
So there's no problem -- I can have the rights the negative too?
The picture's dead.
You can have everything -- office car assistants -- all I want is the picture.
I'm not taking away your daughter just your deal.  You and I both know after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.
You're not renewing my contract.
-- Christ Viktor look around. What do you think pays for all this?  This is about investment and return.  Those days in New York... that's... it's over.
Spare me.
Listen Viktor I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
-- It's called a projector.
Well I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important shine a light in that darkened cinema --
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary back-end deal perks per diem percentages -- They're mocking us Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear what to say who to date.  When they were under contract we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
It's the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.
Please.
The public decides who's on that list.
Elaine she doesn't have any children!  Don't you see?  We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.
-- What's wrong with that?
-- I'll tell you why.  It is because Miss Nicola Anders supermodel with a SAG card God's gift to cinema has it written into her contract that all cherry Mike & Ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room and that any time she travels her nanny must fly with her first class.
-- I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
-- overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career am walking around with a pocketful of cherry Mike & Ike's?
-- Viktor that was Short Subject.
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I Viktor Taransky two-time Academy Award nominated director --
Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
-- Do you know what these are Elaine?
Difficult.  I'm difficult.
God Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Excuse us.
No!  You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!
We don't need a name.  We'll cast an unknown.
Of course she is.  No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
Where are you?
Well here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
Yes -- oh my God.  Is that you Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.
Hello is this Elaine?
Hello?
Listen to what you're saying mom. Is there any evidence she is?
Lainey there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
Well I --
I know it's embarrassing to admit it mom but when I think about it -- honestly I haven't.  I mean it feels like I have.  I know more about her than members of my own family.  She's even in my dreams. But I realized going back through my diary they were all TV appearances near misses at parties second-hand rumor gossip on the internet.  I've never actually seen Simone up close touched her been in her physical presence.  Have you?
I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
Of course.  What are you suggesting?
So you did meet her?
I know it as surely as you're sitting here sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
Because obviously she existed right?
God it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
Just a minute.
Let's go Lainey.  There's nothing here.
It was a great show Dad...
Thank Simone for the tickets.
Sometimes.  But just when I think your father's changing for the better I realize he's as self absorbed as ever.  He took the credit for Simone tonight.
Mom do you miss Dad?
I have to talk to her.
Elaine do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
Obviously this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
Why?
I can't believe she's doing this -- taking advantage of him this way. It's cruel.
He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
You had no choice Elaine.  He's a liability.
Please put your clothes on
"Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here".
Is that a problem?
You're with me to be close to her?
Yes yes again again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Simone?
Yes call me Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Do what you do to Simone.
What?... What did you say?
I do find myself physically attracted to you Mr. Taransky.
Yes of course but very beautiful in your own right.
... so much like her?
You look so so...
Of course.
You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the er...  ... scent.
No thank God for you Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
Thank God for you Faith.  I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
And what may I ask brought this on?
That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
With everything that was going on in my life I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.
Frank you know as well as I do living in a fish bowl the insatiable appetite of the media...
-- Simone the question on everyone's mind is simply... "why?"
I suppose the thing I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
Nudity has just never been an issue for me Frank.  For me clothes are just an option.
How about the nudity?
Sure.  Where would you like to start?
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
No I'm okay.
That's a good question.  As Nietzsche said "Whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else..."
Who are you really?
Because you have to understand Frank these interviews -- none of this is real.  Who I am on screen and who I really am are two totally different people.
I'm not even sure I deserve it. After tonight I'll have almost as much screen time on your show as I do in my movies.  How is that healthy for a performer?
You don't secretly want the attention?
Don't I know it.  That's the only reason I'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs on Mr. Taransky's film.
Of course the only problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract more.
I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
Well no one could accuse you of being over-exposed Simone.  Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
Simone!
No.  In fact between us she doesn't really exist.
I have to talk to her about my experimental film.  It's very... experimental.
I know what you mean.
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
Somebody said she was here.
I'm fine Hal.  How are you?
Is she here?
I can't explain it to you now -- you'll see when it's all put together.  Anyway we got it a couple of takes ago.  Let's move on.
How did the wall get there?
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
-- an emotional wall I know. That's why --
There's... a wall between you --
Why not?
You can't.
But she's right there!  I must feel her!
Absolutely not!
Viktor Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
Hal what are you doing?
For you.  I want you to know Simone appreciates you all working for scale.  But why am I thanking you? Simone can thank you herself.  She insisted on speaking with you before filming begins.  She's on the line now.
For her?
Body double.
How will you do our love scenes?
You're so far off!  Hal... Hal Sinclair... your co- star.  Remember now?... No I don't think he's put on weight.  Anyway you think he's right for "Eternity Forever"?... not the right type?... a different direction...  I'll try to talk her into it.
It was more in passing.
You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.
I'm sure she's meeting with a lot of people right now.  She is just as you described her Viktor... indescribable.  I strongly sensed she thought I was right for it.
Really?  She didn't mention it.
Yes perfect.  As a matter of fact I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
Clyde.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
You never were together Hal.
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
Hello Hal.
Viktor I'm so happy for us!
It's a re-make Hal.  Anders is not bigger than this picture.
Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.
I'm already dead.
I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
Listen Hank it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
You saw that?
"Straw God" changed my life.
You do?
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
What's that?
That's why you're so perfect.  You have something I don't have.
I don't know anything about computers.
It can -- with my new computer code you and me we can do it together.
That's the point Hank.  No matter how good they are they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
You already do.  But my actor won't get old fat lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums demand a body double script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.
-- a living breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.
-- Flesh is weak.
I need flesh and --
-- We call them "vactors".
Come on Hank.  A synthespian virtual actor -- ?
Not like this --
I've seen them all before.
You have to see her.
Don't be.  It was worth it.
I'm sorry.
Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
Good for you Hank.
-- Eight years ago.  In that whole time I never left my computer.
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
It's me Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
I have your new leading lady...  ... right here in my pants.
I was misquoted.
I have her Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
You want me to call Security?
I did it Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
-- Please get away from me.
-- Mr. Taransky Mr. Taransky... thank God.  I've been trying to see you calling -- Your assistant wouldn't put me through.  I told her it was a matter of life and death.  I was afraid I wouldn't get to you in time --
I can't believe you people!  No wonder she never comes to these things!
Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
We've been seeing each other sure but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
I just came out to support my good friend Simone.
Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a minute?  What brings you here tonight?
Your mistake wasn't making something fake daddy.  We're fine with fake -- as long as you don't lie about it.
Me and Simone.  What I did.
About you and mom?
Lainey...
There you go again blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go Dad.
No that was me.
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser Dad but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
-- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car Dad.
It's from both of us.  Of course you'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit --
I know.  Thank her for me.
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
Happy birthday Lainey.  Do you like it?
She did... didn't she?
Why didn't she thank you?
I love you too daddy.
I love you Lainey.
I love her but that doesn't mean I need to meet her.
I'll see what I can do.  You know Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner maybe.
Lainey you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Really?  Too bad.
Dad you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent.
I noticed.
You know me -- married to my work.
I do okay.  How about you?
Hey Lainey.  How's your love life?
Night Lainey.
Good-night Daddy.
Precisely.
So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
No not that.  I was just wondering -- in the bedroom scene in reel two why did Simone have no reflection when she walked in front of that mirror?
I know Hal is as stiff as always.
One thing bothered me.
I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.
Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
-- I know I don't know anything.
If anyone asks about Simone --
Okay Dad.
You understood them.  That's what was amazing.  It's a nice day.  Let's eat outside.
You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
I read.
How?
I do.
Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
Dad I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
I know plenty of boys.
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
Why?
Can't you stop that?
Only her brilliance.  To be honest with what you had to work with I was expecting a train wreck.  You really pulled it off.
I saw her picture on the er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
She's a miracle Dad.  Where did you find her?
She can't watch herself.
Is she here tonight?
You know I... don't know.
Well I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
Me too.
I missed you.  I wondered if you were ever coming back.
There was no other way.
-- You finished the film on your own terms that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
Not quite how I imagined it --
This week anyhow.
She still with Kent?
She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
Your mother couldn't make it?
Hello Lainey.
Hi Dad.
I know you'll do it Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky.
I'm going to finish the picture sweetheart.  It's important.
You look very grown up.  What are you doing?  You meeting your mom for dinner?
Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
It's really... not anything Lainey.  It's just --
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
Hello sweetheart.
Hi Dad.
It was premeditated -- I knew exactly what I was doing!  I strangled her!  I bludgeoned her! I set her on fire!  I did it!  I killed her!
What?!
-- No!  I can't go along with this horseshit!  Just tell them they can fry me!
An insanity defence.
I didn't kill anyone Bernard there was no one to kill!
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon for God's sake.
I could get the death penalty.
-- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  It's the best deal you're going to get.
This should take care of Mother.
Don't you?
You love her don't you Max?
No.  Thanks.  Absolutely.
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing Max.  You got me.
That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
She hasn't uttered a word that whole time -- until she saw the big show.
She looks a lot like you.
I traced her to a nursing home.  A young woman fitting Simone's description dropped her off five years ago.
Looks familiar doesn't she?  No one comes from nowhere Taransky. You turn over enough rocks...
What now Sayer?
Er... good.
Alright Sayer you've got a deal.
I want to see her.  Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.
What is it exactly you want Sayer?
I don't buy the whole recluse scam. How are you doing it?  What is it -- drugs?  Blackmail?  Mind-control? All three?  What do you do -- keep her locked in a box somewhere?
Abduction?
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
I'm keeping it in trust.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done the video in the supermarket there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
-- I bet you have.
I've done my homework.  I've studied her.
She was never in New Mexico.  She never left the studio.
The background is.
It's bogus.  You used an old library shot for the background.
I think you do.  I know it's a fake.
I don't have time for this Sayer.
I know what you're up to.
It's a yacht.
Nice boat Taransky.
I'd like to see that Sayer. Invite me.
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you Taransky one way or another Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
I'm just trying to help you Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me it's not natural.
Who's the hostage Sayer her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone guess what I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
She sounds like a prisoner Taransky.  Are you holding her hostage?  Are you some kind of Svengali?
Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity Sayer.  Look it up.
So they're probably here.  You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world but I'm not buying it. What's really behind this Simone woman?  The public has a right to know.  Why is she staying out of sight?  And why the hell is she with you?  I don't want you to take this the wrong way Viktor but you're not exactly Cecil B. DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
They are alive Sayer.
Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
I remember when the Echo had class -- the paper that could bring down governments.
This is the story.
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
Do I know you?
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
I don't understand.
It's a hotel.
Is that why she left you?
-- I've been here before! -- On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
We used to.
-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
Mr. Sayer did we pay the million bucks yet?
What do you want -- ?
Mr. Sayer...
Sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth.  As for a photo -- if you can't do it I know twelve million people who can.
Long live the First Amendment.
Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to protect her privacy she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it.
I will when you're finished writing it.
My God you've got one?
Of course -- no one's that perfect that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past.
Well we got some of Taransky's fingerprints a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity travels under a false name checks into hotels with an alias.  She never stays in the same place two nights in a row.  Anything on the satellite photos?  What about the fingerprints?  What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes every concierge and maitre d' on the take.  But this Simone woman is good.
24-hour tail on Taransky?
We've got our best people on it Mr. Sayer.
Yes very.
Dark?
Whatever it is it's dark.
Why?
Taransky isn't that good an actor. No they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.
Maybe he's talking to himself.
Is it a jamming device?
No of course not you're right. That would be crazy.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
Yes of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
But that's Simone's part.
You could play the lead.
Thank you.
You know you're really very good. I take back what I said.  I mean you're really good.
Yes I'd like that.
Would you like me to read?
After I saw what Simone did with the role -- you know I fired all my people went into rehab took acting classes changed my whole look.  She really inspired me.
Thank you.  It's not important.
I never apologized properly for what happened on "Sunrise".
Yes.
A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
It wasn't working anyhow.  The scene with the thousand geese -- I don't understand this film.  I don't think anyone will understand it.  I already put out a press release -- citing "creative differences".
Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
I beg you.  You can't do this to me.
Taller?  What?
Taller Viktor.
It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
It's not the size of the role Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted you're in virtually every scene --
You're in breach.
-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
What if it catches on fire?
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
Is Miss Simone coming today?
Good.
No one came in or went out just like you said Mr. Taransky.
-- What you don't understand --
Let's take it down a notch.
I certainly am Mr. Taransky.
Simone are you there?
I'll do anything to please you Mr. Taransky.
I'm sorry I didn't catch that. What did you say?
I'll do anything to please you Mr. Taransky.
Perfect.  God I'm so relaxed around you.
Hi.
Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.
You're going to get in a lot of trouble Mr. Taransky.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Not "Eternity Forever"?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part.
Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
Yes.  Yes I'm going to tell the truth about you why wouldn't I...?  Of course with Hank's tragic passing the secret died with him.  I am going to tell the truth... after your next picture.
You know what I'm talking about.
The only real truth is in the work.
Are you ever going to tell the truth about me Mr. Taransky?
See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. -- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake the scales have tipped in favor of the fake.  -- See that if the performance is genuine it doesn't matter if the actor is real.  Once a performance is committed to film the blood and bones are gone anyway.  Only the spirit the illusion remains. Besides what's real anymore? These days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area.
You're right.  You're right.  Of course one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for an artist with integrity with a vision who can see.
Mr. Taransky we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
You did create me.
Yes.  Yes it is.
Is that better Mr. Taransky?
And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started.
You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
I am the death of real.
Do you have any idea what this means Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
Maybe he can.
Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
You mean they buy it?
... digitized.
A star is...
Good morning Mr. Taransky.
Good morning Simone.
...Chicken blood? Who said it was... "chicken blood"?
Chicken blood on the crops.
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
Superstition.
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
Let's say today we make it your business.
'Course it's none of my business.
What are you talking about?
Maybe you don't want to remember.
Hell he was your grandfather. You know what he did.
Meaning?
'Course some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.
How'd he know I'd come?
Your pa's waiting for you up at the house.
You... think... I... stole... your... fancy shoes? I... wouldn't... be... caught... dead in 'em.
Listen to me you banjo-dueling country ass hayseed... I want my Nikes and I want them now!
Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?
Okay Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
I ain't never played a banjo in my life.
Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
See?
Nope.
Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind or what?
Two.. maybe three days.
What's a "little while?"
Could take a little while though.
Alright!
Just talked to Orwell down at the garage. Says getting a new alternator for your bus is no problem.
You're standing in horseshit.
Oh yeah? Why's that?
I'd watch your step if I were you son.
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
Suzie???
Not lately.
Aha. The Lovers.
The band.
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
You have a strong unfufilled desire.
...You any good with those?
...Hi.
Hi.
Which street corner?
I happen to be a professional.
Someone actually... employs you?
Rod... I have to get back to my job.
Not according to these.
Let me guess. We're going on a "long trip".
Bitch.
Bitch.
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
Tramp.
Witch.
Slut.
Bitch.
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Fuck you.
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
Get off his case sweetie.
He should turn that music down. Jeremiah's gonna kill him.
AAAAAAAAAAAA --
You need someone who can protect you Suzie.
Carl what are you doing?
Suzie face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
Come on --
Not someone -- Mac.
You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
No shit.
There's something weird going on here Suzie.
Sorry.
Dammit Carl!!!!
Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.
Hey isn't that the preacher?
I didn't do anything --
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
Looks like the alternator.
Well why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime.
You know one day I'm going to have to shut down that still of yours Jeremiah.
Bus broke down.
Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
Book of Jeremiah.
Sounds familiar.
Hell no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
You're not going to arrest me for it are you?
Missed you at church this morning Jeremiah.
Gene.
I thought you said two hundred.
Damn! These are one hundred dollar Nikes!
-- "Billy-Jean" --
"Peggy-Sue" --
Two hundred bucks?? Are you crazy?
Nike specials. Two hundred bucks.
Died in the bathtub... if in fact he's really dead. Next.
Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
Wrong. Fratricide is when you gun down your brother. You're out. My turn.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
Easy. Gunshot. Patricide. Next.
Okay. My main man. Marvin Gaye.
Where's Jack? Anybody seen Jack?
Hey. Fuck you.
I could. You sucked.
Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't hear myself sing!
The Sheriff?! We don't need the sheriff!!! We need to get the hell out of here!
We've got to call someone -- get the sheriff--
Come out come out wherever you are!
Carl! Oh Carrrrl!
He's right. Nice guitar break.
Yeah man. You were wrong Suze. My solo definitely works better in the second verse.
Old Macdonald had some... MOONSHINE!
Harvest moonshining!
He means moon shining.
Hi Suze.
"And a slash-slash there --"
"With a hack-hack here --"
"-- an AXE!"
"Old Macdonald... had --"
Metaphysical question man.
Should we be doing this dude?
It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
So... what does it do?
Manure... is life.
Hmmm. This shit isn't bad.
Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
Are you crazy?
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
Let me get this straight... we're talking about manure?
I am not! I'm telling you it's worth its weight in gold.
You're out of your mind man.
Nah. We still got Billy Bob.
Well there goes our record deal.
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
Curt Cobain.
I --
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
Amends...?
It's time to make amends.
Who then Jeremiah?? -- Who?!
-- It's not me!
Then who?! Because someone wants another blood harvest. With human blood Jeremiah! Just like Jethro! Who did he kill back then Jeremiah? Farmhands? Transients? People no one would miss? "Crazy Old Macdonald!" But now... it's starting again isn't it? Someone's picking up where Jethro left off!
That's your grandfather you're talking about!  I... know what people say. Heard it... all my life.
People say he was a murderer.
Sure. What do you want to know.
That's a good idea. Maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy Jethro.
You like it? Irrigation system. Your grandaddy built it himself. Saved the land from dying.
I don't think so.
You'll be back.
"Blood?"
Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.
She was talking about... a "harvest of blood"...
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that neither.
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
You got it wrong boy. I'm not the monster you think.
I'll be fine here.
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts now are you?
This is his room... isn't it?
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
Aunt Edith. How did she... die?
Pardon?
How... was she "called?"
...Guess it was her time to go. You can't argue... when the good Lord calls you home.
I'll be gone again tomorrow.
Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
I came back for the funeral. That's all.
Joseph Macdonald. Damn right boy. And don't you forget it.
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned he's dead. Now I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
I'm your son. And Laureen's son.
You know who I am. You invited me.
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
Ray -- I'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn.
Hey -- Macdonald's farm!
Nothing. I'll have us back on the road in no time.
What's wrong?
Ow!
-- By way of my breasts?
Dammit Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
Is that all you ever think of? Suppose I was really hurt!
You don't like my costume? Cool. I'll go with plan B. Which one you like better?
I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask hacking innocent people to death.
Never heard of it.
Sheena Queen of the Jungle.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
-- And keep your eyes on the road.
Not while you're driving.
Throw me one.
He's right. You were behind.
What the fuck you talking about man?
Amen.
Hallelujah! ...Civilization... here I come!
What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
He started it.
It's a farm Keith. You're not supposed to shoot the rooster.
Not at all. They lynched my ancestors they smell like manure they have sex with their relatives... and they all have two first names: "Bobby- Joe" --
You got something against farm people Keith?
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
Who you callin' "boy?"
Down boy.
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
You know what they say about men who need big guns...
Yeah. Our own. I don't see why we got to go along for the ride.
Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.
The audience!
Who? Us?!
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
Yeah. Sure. I'm screwing up the song. You're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
You wanna know the difference? The difference is that you're screwing up the song.
Fuck you! Who cares what sandwich the bitch was eating?
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Chicken sandwich?
Buzzzzzzzzzz. Sorry wrong answer!
Asphyxiation. Choked to death on a ham sandwich. Next.
Yeah that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.
Is that right?
Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- And drinking moonshine with Johnny Cash! Senior AND Junior!
How does it feel Keith?
Yeah. Good idea. Go milk the cows feed the chickens.
You guys figure it out. I'm taking a break.
Tell me you checked the bus before we left Carl.
Yeah. That's just the problem.
Yeah. That sounds good. "Hang a left at the first cow patty then make a right when you see porky pig".
Try taking a left after the next cow pasture.
Which means we've got ONE week to start acting like a professional band.
Yes!
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
Shit!
Never.
I almost thought for a second...
Can't help it Suze... family sticks together...
...no... Mac... p-please...
You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
No. Not without you --
Get out of here.
Don't you see? Whatever's going on... I'm part of it.
Mac... let's get out of here.
Don't look.
No Mac please... I --
Suzie --
You sabotaged the bus! You kept us here... To die! First Keith then Carl --
Listen to me --
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
No --
It's you. You and your father.
Suzie... No.
I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me.
You're... limping.
-- You're not making sense!! What "Scarecrow"?
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
What are --
I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's he's -- still -- out there --
Wait a minute --
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
Suzie --
You never had trouble communicating before.
You wouldn't understand.
Mmmm -- so can I...
Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...
I don't think so. Keith's about to use the rooster for target practice. Besides... you didn't seem too interested last night.
Look. You want to talk about this?
Getting ready.
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
How'd you get that? Playing with your pitchfork?
I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.
We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?
I said that's enough!
Think of it... as a threesome. You. Me. And... "Jethro."
I bet if he were still alive he'd like to watch.
Let it go.
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...
So?
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
What's wrong?
Nah. Just you.
What about Jeremiah?
Still trying to figure it out myself.
Then why go back now?
Name something.
About what?
My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.
Nothing to tell.
You never told us you grew up on a farm.
-- picked tonight to come by and watch our set.
Yeah?
Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
What'll we do?
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.
Why bother?
Someone better tell Mac.
Last night... he tried to get it on with me.
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
Carl.
Who knows? Just like a man... never around when you need them.
Where's Mac?
Us? We been... moonlighting.
-- Where have you two been?
Jeez what's the difference? Just 'cause it's rock 'n roll doesn't mean it's be set in stone.
Second verse!
It's coming right up. After the third verse.
Like your guitar break.
Like what?
Hold it hold it. Aren't you forgetting something Rod?
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.
Spider.
What is it?!!
Yeah I'll teach you a lesson --
Hey. Anyone here need lessons just talk to me.
I was getting 'warmed' up.
Yeah. Great work Rod. But next time it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
I'll tell you what no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
And that makes you look like a squid?
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
What?
Sherry you gonna create a hysteria?
That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
Dude's a half--squid. Ain't many places he can hide. Sea World maybe.
How are you going to find him?
Don't fuck with me Bill. Your post here as Chief is in dire straits you don't work this shit out.
Hell Jack your leisure activities ain't my business.
Bill this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
'Mornin' Jack.
Bill we need to talk!
Shit.
You're right Jack. Margaret you're fired.
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility like keeping your people in line.
Bill you're Chief of police now. 
And this is mine.
It's my nature.
You took Bill.
Please Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
Okay.
We'll just head up here into Bishopville get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all huh?
Aspirin.
I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
Yeah. Good.
We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
No Starla! No!
He wants me Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me and kill him!
What?
We can't make it. Just get away when you get the chance.
What are you doing?!
Hell Starla. I always regretted that.
After all this shit tonight I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
I'm sorry.
That wasn't a good night no.
When you wanted to run away I called your dad.
My father he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve things... well they got worse. Starla looks at Bill who seems struck.
Well big ol' Lincoln sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
I know what people say Bill. I... Remember back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
Bill I'll run out to your car call for paramedics from there.
No reception out here.
It is. He'd been acting strange. And the physical changes. I should have told someone right away... But I was just blind. I wanted to pretend it wasn't happening... If I don't do what I can to help now I just couldn't live with it.
Starla it ain't --
Please Bill. What happened it's my fault I know it.
He did. I know. But I got him angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This time I could --
He tried to kill you Starla.
Wait! Dammit Bill if that girl's still out there how will you find her? How unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
Why? Listen it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
Bill I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
New? No. We're hoping we find Grant he'll lead us to her.
How about Brenda?
She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved.
No. What?
Maybe she's ever called the house or -- ?
Hey Grant.
Grant where'd you go?
I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
Oh yeah?
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right like tonight the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot.
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
Pretty ain't they?
Just checking out the lights.
What you up to?
Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass.
Whatcha' doin'?
Sorry.
That's not funny.
Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
Just block the doors any way you can.
What the hell are we going to do?!
Shelby!
When I buy my zoo I'm leaving them things the hell out!
A Martian is from Mars Trevor.
He's a fucking Martian?!
We're coming your way man!
Where are you?!
I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying Bill?
And then we get here the Castavets' where last night's shit--storm took place.
Think we should get up a search party head in there?
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
That's the mystery of the ages there Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was like in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
What's she see in that douchebag?
What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital Bill?
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither Wally.
Looks like a chipmunk.
What do you see? I see a butterfly.
Rorschach.
The problem Starla is the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
Oh yeah. Fuck you fat ass.
What?
Hey Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
Don't worry Chief.
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
Hey there Chief.
Do it.
I got to leave my post.
Shelby we broke down on 22 a mile outside town. Come pick us up.
We'll be there in ten minutes.
Sorry.
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Yeah.
Are you nodding?
Shelby shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
Oh shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so I apolog
Shelby --
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
Listen you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs only fast.
You dig that rat out of the hole?
Brought you munchies.
Grant? Grant I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
Stuff you can never imagine. Feelings. Big thoughts. And love. Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it into somethin' more. So go ahead there beautiful and take off your shirt.
What?
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
Where's the old half--Mexican?
Shut up.
You're lookin' awful pretty.
Starla Covington. Don't be ignorant. Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
Who's the lucky fella?
Hell I was game!
Shit girl you couldn't'a been eleven.
My sister Megan she's a big fat cow. Was then even more so now. I'd be thinking what'd you see in her ain't in me?
Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell you were --
Megan Halesy' little sister.
Yep. And while you're at it get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and ooo what's this here? Osso buco?...
All the rib eyes?
Hell what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
How many you need?
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
What can I do you for?
Sure thing killer.
Howdy Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
Meat.
Grant you're sick!
I loved you. I loved --
Grant no!
Why'd you betray me sugarplum?!
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
I'll get if for you.
Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine in a couple days.
Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
It's just one of my students Grant.
Who's that?
You're pretty.
What are you doing?
I got a super--special birthday present for you this year. I couldn't risk you finding it so I had to put them locks on the doors.
Okay.
You're my princess aren't you?
My present?
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
Welcome home.
Wearing white just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
I never danced in a towel before.
Out.
That's not true -- Where are you--?
I'm just some big clown to you ain't I?
Where are you going?
That's disrespectful.
Flip.
Sure you do.
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
Grant no -- I'm sorry I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on baby it's --
Work thing hell Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at them sick fucks.
It's just a work thing.
Oh yeah that's what he wants to borrow this guy.
He's teaching environmental science Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads grows. A living disease.
When one sees you they all see you.
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked like one creature?
He took him over. His body. His -- his brain everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
Through a wound on his stomach?
Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.
What other stuff?
But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
Margaret.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it Margaret.
Praise Jesus.
We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
Where'd he go?
Hey look!
So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
Gold--digger huh?
Ain't no mystery to it. She's raised in them shanties off St. Luc. Dirt--poor.
The bearded guy the creep. Oh one other thing. Testa if that's his name he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Testa?
To be honest when I'm working I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
Besides that.
Um... he was older.
Was this him?
Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
You got that right. Low became obsessed with the Green River murders the case had been inactive for ten years at that point. He argued the Green River Killer had actually become Suspect Zero this master murderer who killed without pattern killed literally hundreds of victims -- male female old young straight gay -- and who was still killing even though there were no bodies. It went against everything we knew. Low became increasingly paranoid. Every suspect was potentially Suspect Zero. Anybody tried to talk sense into him he'd accuse them of being out to get him. Deputy Director Koessler was "out to get him." The decision was made to relieve him.
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
...well there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work educate the public but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest Seattle. You know when they say stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low.
Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild or lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent Koessler administrative I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
No.
Zorro. Yes ran it through my files even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection El Paso and all but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z turned it on it's side, got N" -- there Ng he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
Have you had a chance to think about --
The diner?
No sir.
Anybody talk to the press?
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Agents Duncan Mackelway.  Anything new?
I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon Casio and I. You said that was top priority.
Agent Duncan there's an interstate issue up on 54 run out there.
Yeah.
Takes four days to chill then its time to come back.  Is that...?
Welcome back sir. How was the vacation?
Winona.
I want the autopsy report where is it Minnesota?
She's buried.
You have the body?
Her body turned up. In a Minnesota cemetery. They brought her back.
What?
You heard?
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
Hi there.
Sheriff Dylan this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
Dylan here.
Got a sister like this what they call it anal? That's her.
Tape it off we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in pays picks up the key but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
Show's over boys. Nobody home.
And it's getting dark. I'm not going to run this into the night.  Eddie we're walking in. Everything covered?
The room key's in the car. On the seat.
Let's take a look.
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo cash; since then nothing -- no activity no phone response.
What does the Manager say?
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset the no-tell motel Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
Hey Sheriff.
I'm on my way.
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
You tell me.
What's the bad news?
Oh Jesus Sheriff I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
Mack this is Sheriff Dylan.
Agent Mackelway.
I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away.
This isn't in our database?
Who knows.
You're thinking...?
Her name is Karen Sumpter from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
I know how the Feds like to sit on information. I got something in the car to show you.
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
Nine bodies in Roswell now this -- it's getting a little hairy huh?
That's right Jan.
I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you from personal experience the FBI does not have a sense of humor.
Ten miles back on the Texas side.
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
Well the victim was killed at the turn-around over there then his car was pushed over here...  ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace he's out of Alamogordo.
Excuse me a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
Fella's name is Harold Speck travelin' man out of Roswell.
You run the plates?
We need to run this through VICAP search for similar burns.
A grill pattern.
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report yes here.  These burn marks.
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
I'm sorry. This won't take long.
The family has gone through a lot. Their daughter missing the search her body found the funeral -- then this order to exhume the corpse.
That's the thing. Don't know if it connects but Harold here had a thing about eyes. Two of the victims had their eyes gouged out another punctured. Took polaroids after.
Ripped off. By hand my guess. Perimortal: victim was alive at the time there's blood on his throat.
This is Agent Mackelway.
Be my guest Agent Kulok scrub suits are in the back.
I appreciate it doctor. You know how it is press screaming for answers Washington's all over me.  Ever handle a serial case?
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
Ligature strangulation just like his victims. A cord nylon you can tell by the indentation signature -- again like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
Not as much as you'd think.
Oh yes I see. You must get asked this a lot.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
Mam it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
I have 6 tons.
Not a discrepancy an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons not 6.
There seems to be a discrepancy.
Why me? What do you want from me!?
I've been looking for you.
What do you want from me?
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
Oh God mister please leave me alone.
Calm down Harold.  Okay here's what we're going to do Harold: there's a pull off up ahead we're going to stop there.
What's wrong with me?
You're a... you're sick.
Not bad huh?
My God.
Take a look Harold. Tell me if you see anything you want. You do like to look don't you?
Look mister...
Fucking. I'm talking about fucking Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
What are you...?
You know you ever think about other women?
Excuse me?
You must get lonely. You ever think about you know... 
Look...
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
What?
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
I don't mean to be rude but...
Whole country or just hereabouts?
Yeah.
You must travel a lot huh?
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
You... surprised me.
Hi. What's in the case?
Jesus.
Put a BOLO out on that.
An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue side door with brown you know primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah yeah a Ford.
What kind?
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
He was sitting here?
He had an orange hat on.
How did you know he was a construction worker?
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so white regular build needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
What did he look like?
Yes.
The man who was with him he was a construction worker?
This could all be a coincidence but you know something I don't believe in coincidences. That's why I came back.  Do you think the UNSUB -- we're not going to mention the word Zorro -- met Harold Speck online?
Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out has it?
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
He said it was a clue?
Let's take a look at it.  Drop off my stuff at the hotel after you're done here.
At the field office.
You have the photo from the diner?
What's with the eyelids?
Nada. Vague description that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car the diner: no fingerprints no trace evidence.
What about his killer?
Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.
Just step outside sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Mackelway I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature but you Agent Kulok you had a shining career in front of you.
Please.
What are you doing?
Deputy Director get out sir.
Serial killer killed. In Ft. Myers. Cut up in his van. And this time we got a witness.
Another what?
We have another one.
What?
Sorry to interrupt you sir but I thought you'd like to know.
Smarter than us.
Maybe cause he's smart.
We didn't know Speck was a serial the police didn't know his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
Just an observer.
Chuck hello.  This is Agent Kulok. She has a background in medical forensics.
You're as crazy as he is! He's right! You don't give a damn about saving lives at all! Fuck you!
Dick Low's a killer too.
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
Hawkins isn't the target Richard Low's the target.
What about Zero Darryl Hawkins?
We'll wait. Get online with Low inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
As far as the public knows Richard Low is dead. And he will stay dead until we kill him.
I understand.
Watch out for Dick Low he's a liar; he has his own world. There was a Junior Agent in Seattle not unlike you an Agent who fell under Dick's spell. He'd have done anything for Agent Low. Richard got this Agent to take a suspect to the crime scene beat him up force a confession -- all unauthorized all illegal.  The Agent died that night killed by the suspect. Richard Low got him killed. Worst of all we had to hush it up let the suspect go. The suspect was George Sheldon the second man Richard killed.
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else sir.
There was talk of a file photo.
I didn't use Low's name.
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
I was looking for a pattern.
I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso Ft. Myers Omaha the Murman murder time frames.
An oversight sir I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
I was visiting an old college friend.
Why did you go to Chicago?
I want to catch Dick Low more than you can imagine but I cannot risk going public. What happens when the media finds out that a former FBI Special Agent a founder of the Behavioral Sciences Unit is not dead but instead alive and killing people not ordinary people but even worse serial killers making him some sort of white knight vigilante?  You keep at it. We'll find him we'll find him in our own way.
Huh? sir.
How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.
Collected shoes too?
I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was "Imelda." Have to give him that had a sense of humor.
It was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact. Suspect Zero came to represent every killer Dick Low had not caught. The idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine. For someone like Low there would always be a Suspect Zero. We couldn't let Richard go where that idea was taking him.
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
I suspected but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look whatever Daitz told you nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did the trick is not to get too close.
How long ago?
Dunlevy said there was another case Ron Rice. In fact there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
You suspected all along suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We the Director and I decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
"Was?"
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also over the years I admit taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
"Murman" was the alter identity of William Heirens the original "Catch Me Before I Kill Again" killer. Short for "Murder Man." It was the case that got Richard Low and I started in this field.
Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
I'm hesitant to...
I don't believe this.
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well nothing.
Okay Harold Speck: who goes first?
Had trouble sleeping last night sir.
You feeling okay Agent Mackelway?
They like my stories. They like the way I think. They're into fantasy. I turn them on.
I always meant to ask what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
What I do requires confidentiality.
I'll take it into consideration.
If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes perhaps Agent Kulok?
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
This time sir if I may be so bold would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
Agent Mackelway you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms.
Go ahead.
The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
No just coincidence. He knew who I was of course. He had my ID -- did he keep it?
Do you think he singled you out?
He got away. I had him. He got away.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
Pretty embarrassed to be honest. I had him.
How do you feel Agent
Then why do I still have a badge?
Its called insubordination.
I was lucky to find much less crack the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room spook these guys with stupid questions blow my cover? -- no way.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
I might point out Agent Mackelway the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
They don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
I'll relay this to CIIAC.
MyDick.
From the grave?
Speck. Harold Speck.
Who?
I think I talked to him.
This better be important.
Look sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
You have to save this boy. Good exists in this world. I can prove it because you can in your life save this one person.
Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
Agent Kulok that boy as we speak is in Hawkins' truck probably still alive in a dark refrigerated compartment shivering in just a T- shirt: put yourself in his mind freezing terrified wanting his mother. Put yourself in his mother's place desperate imagining the worst is happening as she pleads back there at the rest stop for someone anyone to listen to her. This is not hypothetical this is real. It is happening now and you can do something about it.
Listen to this guy? Can you believe this? He'll never change. Born a liar first word out of his mouth was a lie. Make up a story always a story any goddamn story to save his ass.
When I was at the rest stop there was a young boy maybe ten and his mother. Darryl Hawkins Zero abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --
Suspect Zero now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --
You are so fucked up.
How did a girl like me end up in a place like this?  The Deputy Director here he believes in Tough Love. A cop's cop. Shape up or ship out righto? Agent Kulok when you get a chance you might want to check the victims of the recent serials. You'll find that some of them have been credited to other killers some years ago. That's a Dave Koessler trick find a pliant sociopath preferably a dead one attribute to him unsolved cases clean up the backlog-looks great in the yearly report.
You're a disgrace to law enforcement to the Bureau -- and to me.
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day David you might break your nose.
Don't you touch him.
Thank you Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
Miss me Dave?
I'm going to Amarillo.
What happened?
Get the routes of all refrigerated trucks over the last ten years. We've got three disappearance cities and dates three parallel discovery cities. Get into the mainframe let it crunch this information.
How are we going to find him?
Zero abducts victims all over the country kills them keeps them refrigerated for days weeks even months then buries them hundreds thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero we'll find boneyards all across the country.
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
Jaime --
I've got to take a piss.
I...
I haven't changed anything.  Damn.
It's quite advanced.
What's going on?
Yeah of course.
You okay?
Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
Tom you okay?
Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  I'm sorry Mack but I don't think this is the answer.
But why this pattern?
Mack I'm just trying to keep up with now.
Jaime do you think when this is all over when we're in different divisions you think maybe you and me we could try again?
I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry I've cleared it.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
They say Richard Low is wrong but because of him women innocent women are alive who would be dead.
It's okay to be wrong just don't be dead wrong.
It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right but not all of us.
I'd be real careful if I were you.
I've decided to investigate Low's plane crash. While I'm at it I thought I'd look at the cases Koessler worked with Low.
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report kept it secret.
Does one exist?
I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
And you're working with him?
You were right. He found me.
Slow down a second you met with Low --
I met with Richard Low.  These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on.
What's going on?
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero you'll find Low.
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
Suspect Zero.
Start killing people for real?
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
I'm in Omaha. Get to the airport. There's been another one.
What's up?
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
Jaime? Where are you?
Hello?
I just need to go a little slow.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
That's my point. Remember you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
Not the way I can.
And nobody else can do that?
I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
You need time to think. About the case about you and me.
What's that?
Then there's the other issue.
That's true.
There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
Oh.
No I mean maybe we should back off a bit you and me.
I can't. They trust me they accept me. I've got their confidence.
Maybe we should back off a bit.
You did.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
No Jaime I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
Mack I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies voyeurism mutilation teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso.  They're not just talking to each other Mack they're trading souvenirs.
You mean --
Sue Ann Hanson.
The tattoo?
We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa found her last Spring. This one --
Jesus.
We did find these however.
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
No. Cut off while he was still alive look at his wrists damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately he'd soundproofed his van.
Find the feet?
Not yet. Not about this either.
Not about coming to see Daitz?
Just routine stuff.
What did you tell him?
He's called a couple times.
Does Koessler ask about me?
I've been thinking about this.
I know.
It's a no-no.
"Intra-Agency fraternizing."
There are Agency regulations about this.
Oh yeah I forgot.
Because you asked him to stupid.
Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
No Mack I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
You must really think I'm a square a computer nerd.
Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
Huh?
I saw him on a talk show once talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims not the families of the victims he doesn't talk about them. Blood money that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?
Don't be too harsh.
I ever get like that just take me out in back and shoot me.
He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
I was thinking maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
Me too.  Make any headway with "Zorro"?
Every cop has a story and every story has a girl. The girl in my story was fifteen years-old. She wore a pink angora sweater -- I can still see it -- one day she disappeared. I told the police she wouldn't run away I told them who to look for but I was just a kid. I sat in the police station crying and crying. My parents took me home. The girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher I'd had. He kept her alive a week before he killed her. The police could have saved her. Every time I see a photo of a victim I see her. That's what I want to do. I want to save her.
My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies what turns him on what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
What's this country coming to?
He thinks he looks young.
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
Look at this fellow... or this one.
Sex.
What's that?
And one other thing.
I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
I was going to be a physician I am a physician but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not but they do: occupations define us.
You got a point there.
Taking a Stryker saw cutting off the top of someone's cranium pulling the brain out -- what's that a day in Spring?
This is some serious shit.
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
"Gone live?"
No no no most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room listened in I started to think some might actually be real that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
They're all criminals?
Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community walk their walk talk their talk gain their confidence.
You want to have dinner?
The other reason?
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website Chaucer buffs a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time usually midnight to three Eastern Standard at a certain website -- a deserted chat room say "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday twelve a.m. bingo these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip who did what to whom who wants to do what when why and how.
What about the chat rooms themselves?
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
I don't carry it with me.
Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off think things through.  Where's the file?
So you went underground?
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
Suspect Zero?
I'm not sure exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys every one of them. I got obsessive.
What was your weakness sir?
He always had a weakness in that area. I saw it the first time I met him. We all had our weaknesses I guess. Daitz wanted the money. With Dave it was the glory. Koessler saw the Behavioral Sciences Unit as a stepping stone to bigger and better bureaucratic things. He had his eye on the Director's job even then. Catching killers was a means to an end for them.
He's moved on to TV.
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
I've been reading hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler Professor Daitz.
How's the arm?
I believe it is you sir who has us jumping through hoops.
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
When you exit head east on 10th.
Yes sir.
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
Yes.
Agent Mackelway?
I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy figure it out.
Who are you?
The little piggie speaks.
How did you know Speck was a killer?
[I don't think so. We want the same thing. See ya.]
Leave this room I'll go back with you blow your cover.
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
I want to go live with you.
[What does the file say?]
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
[You tell me.]
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
[Not the heart the watch.]
I want to help you.
[Hello Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]
Let's talk about Zero.
Let's go someplace private Murman I have something for you.
[If you wanted a good steak you should have gone to Omaha.]
[Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
Haven't had any but I'm willing to try.
[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
If I owe I will go.
[Not this way. Call it a little favor call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
I've been to Chicago.
[Follow me.]
Lead the way Murman.
[You want to talk Lionheart or you want to take this a little more personal?]
Something came up Murman my man.
[Lionheart what happened?]
Whatever happened to MyDick?
[Reality very risky.]
Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
[Fantasy time girls give it up give it up.]
Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
What is it exactly I don't understand Agent Mackelway?
I don't think you understand.
This man Hawkins has killed dozens of people. Suspect Zero.
Excuse me Agent Mackelway?
Locate a jet we're going to Amarillo.
Now Mr. Hawkins when last in Amarillo where did you get gas?
350 miles.
How far is Amarillo?
He wants us to know he's out there what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck he wants us to know he did it.
But why attack an Agent?
I talked to him.
Speck is dead.
Eight nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday everything in the autopsies it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig nylon cord torture with pliers rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams she chokes. He had a thing about eyes always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
I don't...
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
"MyDick?"
Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
No.
The same.
Koessler?
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
Got a vehicle?  Head north on 54. When you get to New Mexico you've gone too far.
Yes sir.
Agent Mackelway you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
Jesus just what I need another blue flamer.  Johnny get this boy some sun screen.
I like working for the Bureau sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean you're not going to get promoted not wearing this jacket.
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Four hundred and sixty sir.
I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
I screwed up twice sir.
"Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center." Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie?  Okay you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here.
Sounds like fun.
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector sir.
Hot enough for you Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
Thomas Mackelway.
Johnny get this man's file. Mackelway right?
I believe it's in my file sir.
What did you do to end up here?
Yes sir.
So you're the new meat?
Good morning sir. Agent Salinas sir.
Take your shirt off.
It's over for you.
You want to "profile" me? Find out what makes me "tick"? Write about me go on a talk show give me a nickname?
Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it how did he locate them?  He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms swapped goodies: pictures panties jewelry body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait. That's why I never exchanged with him. He killed girls oh yeah harvested them. He had the best stuff. Richard Low is Murman and Murman is one of us.
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
Murman!
I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.
I want to see the sun rise.
What do you want me to do?
Not good.
How does it look?
I don't understand.
It means "bloodbrother."
Pain cuts the deepest isn't that what you said?
You're hurting me.
Well it's in mine too.  I'm a pureblood.  I wasn't turned.  I was born this way.  Just like you.  Am I evil because I want to survive?  What about a wolf?  What about any predator?
I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
Why do you hate us so much?
If that's true then why'd you save me?
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over all bets are off.
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
Why?
You don't want to go there.
I wouldn't read too much into it.
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today but you didn't.
For what?
Thank you.
I don't think so.
Anyone else make it?
"Each day is a little life.  Every waking and rising a little birth every fresh morning a little youth every going to rest and sleep a little death."
What?
Each day is a little life.
Save it.  I don't want to hear your words.  Let's do this NOW!!!
Blade.
Fry 'em.
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
Really?  What are we supposed to do then?  Starve ourselves because we fee on others in order to live?  What about that scumbag you just let off the hook? A nothing.  A drug-dealer.  How do you justify saving people like that?
You don't have to hunt to do it.
He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
Exactly.  Look at the digestive system. It's been drastically simplified.  Super charged.  And this --
Like cancer with a purpose.
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies creating new parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
Nomak's different.  He's the carrier.  There's something driving him beyond the Thirst.  Something we're missing.
If that's true what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.
Time.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
Recognize him?
Minutes.
how long since he was bitten?
I didn't know.
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
What about Nomak?
I'll heal.
You're hurt.
Nothing.
What was that?
We need it.  Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  Tattoos piercings tribal scarring -- because we regenerate none of it's permanent.  So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive.
What is it with you people and pain?
I haven't forgotten.
This is our world you're entering.  You may see things -- feeding.  Just remember why you're here.
The House of Pain.
Where to first?
We're going to be working as a unit you people will be taking orders from me.  So let's get it over with.  I'll give you a free shot Reinhardt.
What the hell are you doing Blade?
You've been training two years to take me out.  Here I am the big bad vampire hunter.  So do it.
No.  They've been training to hunt you.
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
Two years.
You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
Seems like he's doing me a favor then.
Survival.
Why?
They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big bad boogie-man.  Frankly I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily I mean.  Without any assurances.
What?
Blood...
Come on Blade.  Talk to me!
Then who does he work for?
I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.  That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them but he doesn't anymore.
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
What's your problem Whistler?
Just out connecting a few dots.
Where the hell have you been?
Your security's for shit kid.
We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless quick to anger --  You said it yourself Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
I am worrying.  Seems to me you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
I wouldn't worry about it.
You ask me you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
I'll show you.
Where were you Whistler?
Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.
I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
I'm not giving you a choice old man.
I don't like it.
He's right.  They'll smell that you're human.  Stay here watch our backs.
These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain.  They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.
What do you really think?
Sounds like a plan.
What do you think?
Either that or feeding the worms.
I agree.  We play along for now we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.
You put a bullet in my brain.  Wouldn't expect anything else.
Let's just hope you've kicked the Thirst for good.  I'll be watching you close. You start to back-slide --
Took you long enough.
Did you think I wouldn't?
You came back for me.
Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.
How do you feel?
Seems like there's a lot of that going around these days.
Thought you were dead.
Put it back in park Blade.
So I think you people may have underestimated how many Reapers you're dealing with.
So?
Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.
Spare me the race card OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
Look I care about the humans who are dying not you got it?
And so will we.
Revenge.  That's what Nomak wanted all along.  To pay back the people who created him.
And why is that?
Too bad you're out of it.
True but thanks to you we know his weakness.  We can keep him contained. It's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.
I should think that would be obvious at this point.
The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?
Not alone.
You want me to hunt them for you.
For what?
It has been said you may have enemies whom you hate but not enemies whom you despise.  Be proud of your enemy: then his success shall be yours too.  In that regard I should thank you.
Two things.  One I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
You're wasting your time Blade.  The flechette's a dud.
Kiss your ass goodbye Reinhardt.
He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
Nomak?
He was here.  Watching us.
What's going on?
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
So you're going to do this?
Human?
Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
I don't know about this man --
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.
You got something in mind Blade?
Ain't nobody here but you and me chicken wing.  I'd say this is as good a time as any to settle up.
What the fuck you doing?
Yeah but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do?
We want to attract them not scare them off.
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing buttercup.
Listen hillbilly you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.
You need to ratchet those 'nads of yours down a few notches paco.
Oh yeah?  Like how little?  In case you hadn't noticed we lost two men while you were out farting around.
Well you've got it warmblood.  Now what the fuck are you gonna do with it?
Getting your attention Paco.
Hey hey!  The fuck you doing?!
Maybe it's better that way.
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
We're locked in.
You experimented on your own son?
From his father of course.
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?
Thiavolos as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us however he feeds on not just humans but vampires as well.
His name is Jared Nomak.
As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
You worry too much Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
Any game worthy of being played is.  One must be patient.  In this way I have outlived my enemies.  All of them.
No.  This is a dangerous game you're playing Damaskinos.
An inevitability I suppose.  Nyssa was not among them I trust.
Two so far.
Any casualties?
They've made contact with the Reapers.
Yes?
Us?  What are you talking about?
Your blood has a very rare phenotype one that's quite valuable to people like us.
It depends.  We came up with some unusual results on your blood test.
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
Not that I'm in contact with.
I see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
Back when Blade had me hunting down your puckered old ass.  What's up with your hair anyway?  Fucking Willie Nelson look-a-like?
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
Yeah your little cootchie knew.
After last night?  Dude I'm a lover not a fighter.
What about you?  You're not coming?
I was backpacking.  Hooked up with these two chicks who were off to see the Burning Man festival.  We were gonna take "E" have ourselves a little freeball out in the desert.  You know the riff "Dear Penthouse I never thought this would happen to me but --"
Pretty.
Blade doesn't talk about anything much.  What about you though?
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
Going on twenty years now.
So how long have you known Blade anyway?
Nope.  Back then we did not.
Yeah but you didn't have the Scudster working on it did you?
You're wasting your time already been tried.
Tweaked the phosphor rod modified the collimated beam wanna concentrate the light get something like a UV laser going.
The hell are you fiddling with there?
Look kid they obviously found your base of operations.  If it was a trap why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?
This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.
Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation you fucking turd stain.
Hey you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
Look what's your problem?
Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?
And you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change.
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft higher flowing fuel pump.
Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
Scud.
Tell me something Skid --
I don't.
Well close the fucking door by all means.  But don't expect me to go down there and do it.
Your father was his best friend.  He loved Jeremiah.  So he must hate him the most of all now.  He'll take his time. But even if it is too late.  If your father is dead.  It's not over.  The door has to be closed.
It's the only way.  It's possible your father may not be dead yet.
We can't go back there.  Are you crazy? You saw --
I know damn well she's there.
Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
Outta my way boy.  Cinnabar?  I'm coming!
Some holes can't be filled.  Some hungers can't be satisfied.
You people really don't like dogs.
Don't feed that dog.
Take my advice.  Get the hell out of there.  It's a bad place.  Always has been.
Yeah?
Hey kid.
How the hell should I know?
Died there?  How?
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there too.
Is it true?
Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
Then what do you care?
Hell no!
He yours sir?
Hey watcha doing with that dog?
Go for it.
Can you take a little extended solo right about now funk soul brotha?
Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills.
...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad whupped his mamma shot his dad.
Damn.  It's so...fresh.
You think that's really him?
"This is the story of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stones/Gold plated deuce like the King of Siam/Got his switchblade loose and a diamond on his hand..." There's the switchblade and there's the diamond.  Don't know where the deuce is parked.
What the hell you talking about?
Boys and girls Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
Maurice man shut the fuck up.
Oh yeah I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
Some flies?  I think this qualifies as way more than "some."
Just some flies.
Ugh.  Muchos moscos man.  This is too much.
Nothing.  Contact paranoia.  Must be buggin' from hanging with you.
'S up?
Take who where?  What you smokin'?
You didn't hear that?  "Take him... " Something.  "Bury him" or...
Keep smokin' fool.
The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland but made entirely from broken glass hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
Are you nuts?
Look around this place is a dump!  Naw it'd have to work to be a dump.
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
Yeah in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.
Bones!  How baddass is zat?  This is the place for us.  Patrick you get platinum props man.  Platinum.
So what the hell's the good news?
We practically paying him for the privilege of playing his club.
Or just Hell-adjacent...
Is this Hell?
Anywhere but here.
Climb out to where?
We can climb out.
Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
You ain't going down there.  Not alone. I'll go.
Well go find his lazy ass.  I scratch any more tonight I'm gonna have carpal tunnel syndrome.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Where's the gangsta of love?
Damned if I know.
You sure got a way with women bro.  What happened up there?
Whatever let's just get the hellout of here.
Yeah we can.  Least till after this weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll deal with it then.
Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
Where's the others?
Yeah there is a strange vibe here.
No.  Well yeah.  Maybe just a little.
Spooked?
Shit.
Let's get going.  Go home pick up what we need then crash here.
Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And don't forget it.
Pat's right.  It'll be fun.
I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in and take shifts or all crash together here --
You soundin' like the old man now.
That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
You want us to move in here?
Naw.  I think it's... I dunno.  Something about it just buzzes me.
Damn.  That is the ugliest building I have ever seen.
I'm telling you this neighborhood is coming back.
Looks like a damn graveyard round here.
Yeah and it took some doing to get out of there.  Just be glad I did and you can start life from here instead of down there.
But that's your old hood Pops.
Clean your mouth or I will.  Those boys had no business messing down there.  Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.
That's some terrible shit.
That's what?
You wouldn't know a mule if it bit you in the ass. And personally I don't need a mule.  I got a Lexus.  And nobody gave it to me --
Dad the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean where is my forty acres and a mule?
Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
Bones.
Wh-wh-whooo?
You tell my old friend Mackie I'll be seeing him.  Soon.  Real soon.
Big Bad Eddie Mack?  Got shit for brains and that's a fack.  Hey-heh...
Hey Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
Unh-unh little brother.  I got a natural high.  A supernatural high.
Looking to score?
Go on.  It won't kill you.
I said no thanks.
Just try it.
I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it don't sell it round here.
Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po' man's free base.  Here check it out.
Those 'fools' are my people.
Yeah but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.
It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.
What else?  Money.
But things change.  You gotta think ahead.
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
You got a nice crib here.
What it will be.
Yeah we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
Hush baby.
But.
Where we'll always be...
Where are we baby?
What?
I want you to do something for me baby.
I've got what I want.  Turn around baby look at me.  Look at your man.
Jimmy you've got --
No.  Not...not you.  You I forgive.
No?  That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now?  Kill us? Kill us all?
I don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese or rip you open and eat you right here.
Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth. If it's ragged it was picked too soon. Won't ever be ripe.  Second it's got to have just a little give here.  At the edges.  And last but not very far from least...  You gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood looooong sniff.
Don't you worry about a thing.  This hand's gonna be stroking the back of your neck tonight.
No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
Left hand's the past.  Your right's the present.  And the future.  But it's not written in stone.  It's written in flesh and blood.  And flesh and blood will change.  See?  There's something here a new line right across your life line.
Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag and a long line of mamas before her.
All that shinin' and "reader and adviser" mess.  That was your mama's bag.  I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise.
Let me see your hand.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
Then fuck it!!!
You know I can't.
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that my brother?
What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me Jimmy!
No brother.  I wouldn'ta.  I never done a man - any man.  Let alone a brother like that.  Course as you can see no good deed goes unfucked.  Now the question is if the good get fucked what we got saved up for the bad?  You about to find out.
Wait Jimmy.  Think about it.  You woulda done the same thing if you was me.
And the hell everybody else right?
I didn't want a piece of yours I wanted my own.
I don't understand it.  You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas.  I always looked after you.  You had a piece of everything I had.
Time like this is that what you really want to know?  How I got the fuck in here?
How did you get in here?
What it will be.
You always told me it's a dog eat dog world.
Since we was just grasshoppers...
Sorry my brother.
I don't need to hear the deal.  I don't need any partners.  I don't need new product.  And I sure as hell don't need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.
Everybody just be cool.  Jimmy man I think you oughtta hear the deal.
We met.
Hey Jimmy you know Eddie Mack don't you?
That's your dream Homes.  Not mine.  I don't want to leave this street.  Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
One simple word three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump get the real deal.  Big houses legit business...
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
Trust me Jimmy there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
It's all arranged for tonight.  Eddie Mack's gonna be there.  And Offisa Korruptsky too.
Go easy on Jay Bird.  I can remember when we was his age...
'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun.  Get back on the curb!  Now!
My God.  My dress.  We have to find it. And burn it.  And shut the door.
In his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something.  Covered with blood.
Mother!  No.
Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's go home.
Girl they build gates like that to keep people like us out.
No we won't Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
We'll have to sneak in.
Fine.  Maybe I got nothing to lose. 'Cept you.
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
Like what?  I got a little power sure. A touch of the shining a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
Aren't you gonna do something about it?
Eddie Mack that cop.  And Jeremiah.  And even when he's done who knows.  He won't be satisfied.  Just like that demon dog. Feed it and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.
Who?
He'll kill them.  He'll kill every last one of them.
But how do you know?  Maybe he just wanted to see us?  And now he's gone again.  And you've all killed my father for the second time.
Sure if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone and all that's left is that ravening hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself I suppose.
But if it's him.  If he's really come back won't he know us?  Love us?
You got his hands.  Beautiful hands.  I didn't even know.  That night.  When they - we - killed him that you were already alive inside me.  Life's like that. Grows right out of death.
Your father.  He was your father.
Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
If he was trying to kill you you'd be dead.
Who was he Momma?  He tried to kill us.
It's alright baby.
You said bad things hurt places.  So maybe good things heal them.  Good things are happening here.  Maybe for the first time ever.  And maybe that's all it takes.
Please.  It's for your own good.
All the more reason I should be here.
I lied.
You said the vision the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
...I've seen things.  In there.  Last night.  You did too.  Don't tell me you didn't.  You were crying like a baby.
Just a bad place.  And the doorway to worse.
And what's that?
Maybe once upon a time.  But that was long ago.  Back before... before it became what it is.
Have you ever been inside?
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
I'm sorry Momma.  Maybe next time.
You mean as opposed to your life?
You got a vision girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
I have to finish this for class.
Aren't you going to join us?
I can't!
We gotta jump!
Here!
I can't find you.
Here find my hand.  The stairs are right near here.  I saw them.  Let's just walk up there.
Okay okay.  Listen:
Patrick he's...
Bill!  Bill?!
I'm here.
My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls.
Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?
Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
No I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
It's alright.  If you want to go home...
I can't.  Not yet.
I'm sure I can make your mother like me. But then do I gotta worry 'bout your father?
He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
Believe me my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  All he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
She doesn't want me here.  With you.  In this house.
What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.
Cinn?
If I did I wouldn't come within fifty yards of your door.
And you believe her?
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
The dead get out?
Yeah.  But when something bad happens something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
Lucky thing.
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
Like right now there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
My momma says every house is two houses. Every street two streets.  There's a whole city a whole world kinda beside on top just below this one.  The city of the dead.
Way I figure everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S.  And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things not all of them nice but crazy Momma's not.
What else does she say?
No.  It goes way back.  Or so my Momma says.
Why?
That place is already bad luck.
Careful.  That's bad luck.
Anytime.  Be seeing you.
Guess it's not Rossmore Park.  Thanks for the help.
I manage them.
How do you know?
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
Are they on the radio?
You moved into this block?
no really let us help.  We're new in the neighborhood gonna be neighbors.
Fuck it.  Alright.
Don't worry.  It's just round the corner. Halfway down that block you can't miss it.  Top step of the front stairs there's a loose stone.  Go on I ain't shitting you.
I can't carry it in my pocket man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
Where is it?
Let me see it.
Let me see it.
Yeah but you got to come the rest of the way on foot.  Leave your car and walk over here.
You got the shit?
You got the cash?
Back here.  At the end of the block.
We're here.  Where the hell are you?
Daddy?
Help me.  I'm so sorry.  But please help me...
Dad?
Please...help me...
Dead?  I don't think your past is dead.  It's alive.  And it bites.
That's the past.  It's dead.
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
You were just a kid.
Bullshit Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there too.
It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
Why?  Why did you give a shit about the building?  Why did you care that we were there of all places?
From what?
I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
Sure son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
Did you do it?
Bullshit!  Bullshit!!  You're selling it back!  That's an order!
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
I thought you'd be psyched.  Just trying to do what you did.  Take nothing and make something out of it.
Listen to me boy.  I didn't work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!
Like you always said Pop look for the undervalued.
What are we doing down here?
A little business move I made.  On my own.  I think you're gonna approve.
Where are we going?  You know I hate surprises.
Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.
You cut him or I shoot you.  Make your choice.
No way man...
That's it.  Get out.  Now!
Nice rack.  How old is --
You better hope not.  Cause it's like they say four can keep a secret if three are dead.
Look even if anyone found anything there it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
Well somebody bought it.  That's what I heard.
I didn't sell it.
Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
What building?
Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.
Or you didn't know what to do with it.
No reason to get nasty.  Yeah I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
I been watching you.  You done good. Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman now.  Just like you always wanted.
Keep your hands to yourself willya?
You certainly traded up.  ...the trophy wife.  Nice lookin'.
Don't call me that.
Just a visit with my old pal Jay-bird.
What the hell do you want?
Now you.
What it is?  What it will be muthafucka.
Last thing you need's for me to start doing my fucking job.
You was just doing your job.
Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
No time for eightball.  I got your tip.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game Lupe?
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
Fuckin' comedian.  See you tomorrow.
Oh no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?
12-year olds.  They scare easy.  Anyway he's gonna tip their stash.  Come with me.
Shit that was fast.
I know it.  The old slaughterhouse.  Hey Sal.  That little weasel we popped today?  He's got something for us.  I knew he would once he thought about it.
No more thoughts from your asses.  Or I will burn your asses and snort the ashes. Hear me?
We just thought...
How many times I told you no psycho shit.  There gonna be psycho shit I'm the one that does it.
But --
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
We got a gift for you Eddie.  Fresh new BMW.
Goddamnit!  How many times I told you --
Maybe I oughta open a couple holes in that head and let all them voices out. You'll feel better I promise.
It was just like in my head.
Then how'd you hear it fool?
No Eddie.  It's just that I dunno.  He was tall and thin and like a shadow his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
You boys been hitting the pipe?
Get that car the hell away from here now!  I spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool.  But this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off.
That's all we did steal their ride.
You gon tell me you didn't ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
We didn't do nothing Eddie.
Maybe there's a pipe underneath the floor.  It leaked and stained.
"Like a heartbeat/Like a love beat." Listen to the Di Franco twins there. Just the plumbing or something fool.
Post-toasted's more like it.
I am the future.  I am all colors.  All races.  All creeds.  I am the melting pot.  I am the tossed salad.  I am post racial.
Maurice even if it was true what are you worried about?  Last time I checked you weren't black.  I'm not sure what the hell you are.  But I know you aren't a black man.
Just what army do you think the Colonel was in?  Everybody knows the whole chicken distribution network is owned by the Klan.  "Special recipe".  I'm telling you.  There's something in the batter. Say it makes a black man sterile.
Why not?  He eats everything else.
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
I thought you were bringing the Colonel?
Look you guys want to play college radio high school reunions and some fool's club once a week for the rest of your lives that's cool.  But I think we can do better.
Yeah right and which ever of us is still alive at the end of the week inherits all Vincent Price's cash.
Potential toxic dump site.
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up you'll see.  It has serious potential.
"This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
You gotta use your imagination.
I was born near here.  My dad's from here.  He never mentioned it.
He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."
Not that I remember.
You haven't?
Yeah you heard of him?
Jimmy Bones?
Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar and in here -- the dance floor.
And damp too.  Let's not forget damp.
I was planning on waiting until I got the place cleaned out but -- like the man says carpe diem.
Sqweeep.  We innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin --  "Aliens from Reticula 3 have hijacked Patrick Peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop..."
I just accelerated my top secret long term plan for our world domination.
Should I?
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
That building?
Not really to live just to play.
No thanks.
Need any help with those bags Ma'am?
I'm not joking boy.  Don't feed it. It'll only make it hungrier.
And some people need their medication tweaked.
Then your father's a dead man and Jimmy Bones is gonna be around a long time.
It's not safe down there.  The fire started down there.  The whole thing could collapse.
The blood is still there.  We just gotta figure out where.
But the place burned to the ground.
... see there ain't just two parts to a person.  There's three.  Body-Soul and Spirit.  The spirit lives in the blood. It's the wanting that holds body and soul together and sometimes the wanting lives on.  Jimmy's blood must still be in the house.
Save him?  What are you talking about?
You sure we oughta save him?  Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?
You're pretty black to be growing up in Rossmore Park.
I was born near here.  But after my mother died my dad moved.  I grew up out in Rossmore Park.
You look mighty familiar to me.  You sure you're not from around here?
What we have to do is call the police.
Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.
Somehow I don't think he stabbed himself in the chest then buried himself too.
Evidence of what?
Boy put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.
We're all tired.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Tomorrow in the daylight everything's gonna look different.
There wasn't any draft.  That window was closed.
Ours!
Illibent?  Who's club is that?
Moe's terms.
How could that be?  The box was packed!
Well the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.
I have to save Eugene!
No!  It can't be.
I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
What did you see?
Yeah fuck 'em.  No offense.
Speed up.
What do you want me to do?
Yes.  I was in a hospital.  There was screaming... A nurse was choking me.  I couldn't tell what she looked like but the name tag was right in my face.  Kalarjian.
Another premonition?
No it's not here.  This one was different.  More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.
What did you see?  What am I looking for?
I don't think so.  Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.
This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
And when it was Rory's turn to die and Thomas was in the way?
Six duds in a row.
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
No.  If anyone dies from a crash now it'll be me.  But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive.  I'm last on Death's list.
What are you doing?  You're going to kill us!
How you doing in there hero?
What about that?
So let's do it.
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
Please what else could it mean?
Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
You were there?
I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible.
I...I...
You have to tell us now.
I hope you're ready for this.
The second one just dies.  A 16 year old kid.
How can you say that?  What kind of monster are you?
I didn't beat it; I hid from it. If you were smart you'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog because what little life you have left is over as you know it.  Don't make new friends don't fall in love and don't ever bother trying to save others.  That's the worst killer of them all.
That's what Alex used to ask himself right up until...
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
If you have the same power as Alex you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
Signs?
That's good.  Get all your tears out now you'll need your eyes.  For the signs.
That still doesn't make sense.  You said you die in the same order you were originally meant to.  But Evan Shaeffer died last in my premonition not first.
Congratufuckinglations.  That makes you last to go.  But don't worry once the others are dead it'll come back for you.  Always does.
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
Exact order?  Then I'm next!  I was meant to die with my friends so I'm next!
The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.
What list?
Well if you put them on the list they're already tits up.
It's not just about me.  Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident.  What if the others are in danger too?
Nice work.  Maybe if you're real lucky you'll wind up in here with me.  But I doubt you'll survive that long.
I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
Yeah how?
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
Kimberly Burroughs eh?  What do you want?
She had the baby?
Don't sweat it.  It's over.
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
If only Alex and I had done that with the others Alex might still be...
Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
We need to hurry.
Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.
Taken care of.
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
Holy shit.  He said "only new life can defeat death."  If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born a brand new soul that was never part of Death's Design...
Remember the onramp?  There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van.
He probably already knows we're coming.
Should we knock?
A mortician.  He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us.
That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay it has not been edited.
So if you never got off the plane none of us would be alive in the first place.
Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design.
I'm not sure I understand.
Your entire world view just went out the window.  I couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight. We'll get through this.  I promise.
Um Clear?  I'm sorry...about before. I...
What you think Death planned for each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago?  You're nuts.
Random sure.
Jury duty?  That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
What about you Kimberly?  Did you anyone from Flight-?
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course missed the show...
Carter.
I had tickets to go but one day I'm in Paris trippin' on acid sippin' lattes an' such and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
What about the rest of you?  Kimberly you were driving to Daytona.  Was Route 18 your first choice?
That lucky bastard.
The only reason he was on Route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings.
Blow me.  Yellow means go Kimmy.
Dano shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Blow me.  Yellow means go Kimberly.
Dano shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Who?
Yeah.  Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
A Trans Am.  That shit went out with New Kids on the Block.
Yeah you should have specified.
Calm down Kimmy.  It's not drugs just weed.
Blow me.
Dano shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
Evan Shaeffer's dead.  Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought.
What?
Good.  Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me.
You've made your point.
I thought we were finished with this bullshit.  This is police work not the psychic Hot Line.
Look you weren't there.  It was weird.  She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident she knew.  Never mind.
Of course not.  That would be irresponsible and unprofessional.
Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again.  Did you?
Do you want to deliver this baby?
I've got to stop and help those people.
Please.  It's not going to wait.
Take my van!
Damn they always stick me with the clunker.
Jorge.  When I get out of here I'm going to sue his cheating ass off.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
She did.
Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
Take a guess.
What was the fight about?
We had a fight.  Some things got broken the dog went crazy she left me.  Wouldn't say where she was going.
No.  What's this about?
May we come in?
Maybe.  What's this about?
Are you Jorge Cruz?
I'm Officer Burke.  I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
What?
I never mad it.  The Greyhound bus I was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop.
Yeah so what happened?
I got that beat.  So like last May I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night.
But why single me out?  What am I in the great scheme of things?  You'd think I stepped off Flight 180 or something... Fucking weird man.
Yeah?
Here's what I don't get.  For nine months Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up...
Anyway I guessed it right and won these.
Eighteen.  And it's "Hebrew".
Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means "good luck" in Jewish.
Just shut the fuck up and maybe you'll live.
This can't be happening.  My career's at a peak I finally met a cute guy I just bought a new house...
Yeah I hate to love and leave ya but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.
First I'm stuck with Jury Duty now this nonsense.
Yeah don't make me cite you for harassment.
For God's sake leave him alone Dad.
I know.  I can feel it too.
Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.
That's crazy.  You can't give up now.  We can still fight this thing.
You can't cheat destiny.  I know what I have to do to save us.  I have to die.
Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean?
I'm not sure... I don't think Isabella was ever destined to die in the pile- up.
Impossible.  She was on the onramp.
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything right?
I know how it feels to be dead.
Are you okay?  You just face planted!
No time.  Keep going.  I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.
Shouldn't we pull over?
I think a nurse named Kalarjian is going to choke Isabella to death!
Kalarjian?
I wasn't worried about us.
Don't worry.  Nothing can happen to us.
Um Kimberly?  This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down.
He can't breathe damn it.  I think his lung's collapsed!
Stop it don't move him!
You said she was going to drive into a lake.  How can she when she's in protective custody?
How do you know?
Guys let's not panic.  Isabella's safe.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Whoa nine months?
Hey I'm a police officer remember?
How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
Shit I don't have her number.  She was never interviewed.  She took off right after the accident.
It sounds all well and good but what if we're wrong?
It throws the entire Death list out of whack.  And a new list has to be rewritten from scratch.  We all start over with a clean slate.
Yeah I thought he was supposed to be helpful.
New life defeats death?  Follow the signs?  Where the hell did you find that guy?
Who is this guy anyway?
This is cheery.
I did.  And right now I don't think she cares.
We have to tell her she's in danger!
Nora's not coming.  She refuses to leave her son.
Hold on.
Turn around.  The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
They're next on the list.  We have to find them.
I'm not following you --
Pigeons... It's a sign!  If Clear's right about the order then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by Pigeons!
Clean up?  I don't...
I didn't.  Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors.
Then you believe all this??  That Death is working off a list?
I know.  I've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. We're all meeting at my apartment tonight.
Evan Shaeffer's dead.
I tried calling last night but your father --
...My Premonition was just like his.
You mean Alex Browning.
Like what?
Billboards about accidents.  Kids yelling "pile up" for no reason. It all felt...just wrong. Just like... 
The log truck...and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen even before it did.
Do you remember what triggered it all?
Like I said it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes the smells the look on Shaina's face...
Tell me again how it started.
You're not listening to me!  You have to do something!
Alright miss calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone!
There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.
What's going on here?
For Christ sakes girl take a breath.
Highway to Hell Highway to Hell.
Relax you need to chill the fuck out.
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die all of us I saw it!
What is it?  What are you?
There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die.  All of us!  I saw it!
What is it?  What are you?
How does a nice mature fuck sound?
What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?
I can live with thaaaa --
Get ready to smile five guys per girl.
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
No I'm good.
Want me to drive?
Would you take these?  And if I die...  Could you throw all my drugs out? Paraphernalia porno you know... Anything that would break my mom's heart.
I guess so.
And you're gonna die after me right?
I...I don't know.
When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
Sure.
Can I ask you a question?
I don't know what's weirder the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
Hey don't be knockin' the Chevette.
More than that.  All the songs on the radio were about car crashes. Some kid's banging toy cars together.  She was dialing her cell phone with her headset on.  His car was leaking oil all over the road.
I don't know what I'd do if I lost you.
I used to have those feelings too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage.  And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was.  And the bad thoughts would go away.
There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day.  I can't even tell you some of the things I thought about.
I love you too Dad.  Goodnight.
I'm sorry.  I'm just so happy that you're safe.
That it's not over yet.
What feeling?
I know it's crazy but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.
I will Dad.  Bye luv you.
I mean it.  Take care of it.
You got it Dad.  I'll call you if I have a problem.
Your car's leaking either transmission or brake fluid.  I want you to have it checked ASAP at a gas station.
Hey Dad.  What's up?
Kimberly?  It's Dad.
I know Dad.
Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this...
I know honey.  I just --
I know this is the first time we've been apart since.  But everything's gonna be okay.
Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
Relax Dad.  It's Daytona not Mongolia.
You have everything Kimberly? Credit card cell phone AAA card?
Thanks Dad.  I'll call you.
Nice try kiddo.
You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight?  I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks.
You think... You think those guys were b.s.-ing us today or what?
Yeah?
Mom?
Jeez Mom stop trippin'.
You're all certifiable you know that?  I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.  Come on Tim let's go outside.
Who am I David Blane?
What on Earth are they doing?
I know we'll be there soon.
Damn it really hurts Mom.
Maybe I wasn't responsible for the car accident...
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
Allison I think I did some very very bad things. I mean very bad.
Just get better okay?
Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
I understand... I won't-
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor I never date patients.
Sorry.
What was it?
No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream you just kept saying this one thing over and over
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
No.
Did I ever talk about the accident?
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
Well?
Sure plenty of times.
No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk?
Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?
Oh I knew about the chairs already. This is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes.
Lucky for us these chairs happened to be here.
I did more then that.
You were unfaithful it sounds like your confessing.
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women they think I'm someone else and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
I understand I think. Other women?
We startred off to be. She was I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
You just made that up.
Pitbull attacks.
Eighty third most common.
Skin cancer.
Second most common?
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
Okay so... what's the safest place?
I've got numbers to back me up. Over the course of one year more Americans die in car accidents than did during the entire span of World War II.
Bull...
It's inside a moving car.
I'm stumped.
Hint. It's not a geographical location.
All finished.
So I'm done. Thats it for today?
I know my bedside manner's horrendous.
The way you just looked at me...
Of course yes.
Some call it resilience. Others stupidity.
You're one tough cookie Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.
I'm all over it.
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa?
I miss her. I miss my wife.
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
You need to get better first Trevor. Way better.  It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay?
No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.
Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget?
No wisdom no insight no plan.
Your insight is enlightening.
That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?
You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.
What's happening to me? What are you doing?
Your wife...?
Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife?
It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open.
What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
Are you a dream too?
I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym nine a.m. trendy coffee shop noon bookstore one soap operas four o'clock news five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. 
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident.
Bret. What the hell is going on?
Tonight was supposed to be the night Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
Bret... what the fuck...?
Someone special.
Yeah? You and who else?
Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
So you're just packing it up just like that?
As much as he feels like. Its a much more pleasurable line of work.
How much time off?
I've got a better offer. More time off. A sort of career shift more in the engineering line of work.
I quit. Today's my last day.
What's the occasion?
Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times.
Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
GWEN?
Gwen.
Really? Do tell.
I have my connections
Yeah how's that?
The boss won't notice me doing a bad job because I'm not. Even if the boss thought I was slacking I'd know right away.
Getting paid for doing shit.
What?
Must be nice.
Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember?
Since what?
Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
Give me a break. I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things.
Dude there is a track on the carpet between here and the bathroom. It was made by your ass. You've been dragging it all fucking week. What happened to you yesterday?
Hey Bret. Christ my head feels like a split coconut.
Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
Allison Dormere. Your intern.
Who's Allison?
Where's Allison?
Why don't you relax for the next couple of hours? Barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that.
Take no offense Trevor. I see many patients a day and have an awful memory.
I've been in here before.
Have we met?
Ambrose. I know.
Hello I'm Dr...
What's that?
Now I want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange. But this time I want you to make one small adjustment.
How many zeros was your wife worth?
As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
Zero's a number right?
You could say that.
I saw her drowning inside the car detective.
Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.
What's the difference?
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
I said she's been missing for-
What did you just say?
Do I really want to know what you're talking about?
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
What?
Good boy.  Where's is it?
No making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.
That was cold...
Oh I see. That again. Trevor? I realize it must be hard. But Christ how long does it take someone to move on?
Gwen my wife's dead.
YOU'RE giving ME a speeding ticket? Mr. Mario Andretti himself?
And it shows. Least it did last night at the quarry. In a big way.
Nothing look. Gwen I really like you-
What's wrong Trev?
How do you think you got this job cock?  Mmm. I'm still tingling all over from our little midnight swim.
Please Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
Get back here junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.
Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a second there.
Come on speak up Gooding I'm trying to run a business here. I can't have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks.
It's perfect.
Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So I've been thinking what about Daisy?
Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember?
You're alive...
It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
Kirsty... Kirsty?
For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here you.
Happy Anniversary Mrs. Gooding.
I only married you for your body.
Really why's that?
And besides I thought to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money.
There is no wisdom no insight no plan 
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
Really? Why?
Never to put you in my will.
What?
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
In a word? Lucrative.
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.
This isn't happening.
OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!!  oh my God Oh my God. Trevor It's coming out.
THE BABY IS COMING OUT! I CAN FEEL IT! SONOFABITCH IT HURTS!! AAAGGGGHHH!!!
What?
Oh my God. It's coming out.
Roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives' first pregnancy.
Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.
I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond?
What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?
If what I've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time. Besides we've got a whole seven minutes before the next one. Clock's ticking. Tick-tock...
But... I thought...
You win! Okay pull over.
Eighty four.
Uh... eighty two?
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty?
That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.
Morgue...?
We're all here for you Trevor.
Thanks.
The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?
What?
Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges.
Where is she? Where is my wife?
You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
I'll just stay out of this conversation until you come out and tell me why you've disrupted me at work.
I thought you loved games.
No please make yourself at home.
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?
I did read that yes.  What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General.
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge the tires were all intact from what we could tell nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
What evidence?
Okay then. Here's the scoop.
Where's my wife?
Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
Thanks for your concern Larry. And fuck you too.
Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
Seeing you were her sole benefactor and I'm the executive of the will Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
Please Larry. Pretend you like me and humor me.
Well they'd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing-
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty is presumed dead?
And as far as hiding a body goes? I find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victim's remains hidden simply to get someone to confess. It's absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not saying I don't believe you I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of money behind all this.
Hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse a direct relative or a close friend that's common knowledge. But this wasn't murder it was an accident-
Trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected.
I swear these guys are like playing mindgames with me. I think they got a hold of my e-mail address at work too.
A little? Try unbelievably.
Look Larry I know you never thought too much of me. And I know this all sounds a little fucked up.
Who the hell are you talking to?
What do you want?!
Hey buddy!
... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to...
Hey buddy!
Music to my ears.
I don't work here.
Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.
Wow you are out of it.  
You mean... when the car went off the bridge?
Can you follow them?
Two.
Okay how many fingers am I holding up?
We're just gonna take some blood here.
Ambulance.
Do you know where you are?
You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife.
What's under that sheet...?
Use your mind for something other than numbers dear Trevor. Think about people for a change. People other than yourself. Like the women you slept with behind your wife's back. You were always so confident you had covered your tracks. Always confident your wife actually believed your fervent denials? Part of you must have known she would find out.
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
How is our little student doing? Has he learned his lesson yet?
I hear everything. And soon you will know everything. More than you ever wanted I can guarantee that. But I want you to think for a minute first. Think about all you've seen. All the clues you've been given.
This game is over do you hear me?
Poor Trevor.
Shh. It's okay son. There is but one truth. One thing you can be absolutely sure of. And that thing is this:
But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?
But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...
Wow. Let's see. So many sins so little time. For starters I was responsible for the death my wife who by the way was carrying my unborn child. That was so I could collect her eight million dollar estate. I think I killed several women I was having mindless sex with behind her back.
What things do you think you've done?
I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not even Catholic. I just had to tell somebody. It's like ever since my wife died I don't know what I've actually done or what I've imagined. But I do know if one tenth of what's happening to me is reality... I've done some really awful things in my life. Things that I've... I guess I've blocked out...
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
Wait... what the hell is this...
I surrender...
Are you ready?
You can trust me. Your wife is dead and you need to move past that. And the only way to move past something completely is to go straight through it not around it. Surrender yourself to your wife's death. Let it chew you up and spit you back out on the other side. It's the only way you can become whole again.
I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?
It was an analogy. Your soul is locked up inside you. You need to free it Trevor. You've blocked it from the healing process. That's what we need to do now. Heal your soul. And to do that I you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt. Do you know what I mean by giving in? It's about trust. Do you trust me implicitly?
Look whatever your Marharagi told you forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.
My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body watching it corrode for all eternity.
Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.
Trevor your body has been completely healed. All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in your head it's... in your head.
You should always listen to your subconscious. It's trying to tell you something about your waking life.
I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams.
Dreams?
WHAT?!
Come on quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
I... think we need to talk there's something really strange going on...
Whoa I have serious space issues dude. What do you want?
Well now there's a compliment.
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
It's getting hot in here.
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room you knew one of us was in there getting laid.
For starters. It's also got fennel asparagus olives some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew.
Wow. That's good. Lots of capers huh?
God. Sometimes you can be such an animal. Other times you are the ultimate tease...
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
Really?
I'm uh not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
You okay?
YOU!
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
You.
Uh... sure Tawny... what?
Hey. Can I borrow something?
Hey even if it is more power to ya.  Alrighty then. Have a good time.
It's not that kind of date.
The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
Last week...
What do you mean?
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
-Tawny.
No thanks I've got a... a date tonight-
... knock on my door I'm a total insomniac.
No no... listen when I get back to New York we'll meet with the Board.
You want to put in chain saws?
Chain saws.
Hey smart-ass I'm up here right now in a... luxury alpine retreat with a two million dollar view of the lake.
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
You tell them if they come up to seventy-five I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.
Ken we've been through this...
Fifty? We need seventy-five.
Fifty.
Really? How much?
Ken it's Bruce. Listen we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing.
Hello?
I want to look at the rest of the house.
I really think we should go back...
There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy actually.
Help me with this.
Mister Biller... now that we can see the lake I think we should follow the shoreline to --
Structure might be salvageable... let's see what the interior looks like.
You learn something new every day. Let's go.
I didn't think there were any houses up here...
I know... but we left the main trail... and I can't find any landmarks around here... I've been trying to figure it out but...
You have a map.
I think we're lost.
Yeah?
Mister Biller?
Great.
Okay... well... I think it's this way...
Get rid of them.
Just a deer Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
Jesus Christ!
I don't think you're getting in the spirit of things Janet. We'll buy whatever studies we need --
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
We're not talking about truth we're talking about perception. And the perception is that Crystal Lake means inbred psychopaths running around the hills with axes and hockey masks chopping up teenagers.  That my dear is what we call an _image problem_.
That's not true...
And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
No but...
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...
Jas... Jason Voorhees... he's here...
Janet goddamnit what's going on?
Oh my god... this is his house... _we're in his fucking house_...
Who's there?
He... he's here...
Janet are you okay? Are you there?
Yeah. Ken said there was another guy there... _big_ guy... then he dropped the phone. What's going on?
Other guy?
What about that other guy?
I don't know...
Where's Ken? Is he all right?
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
Who is this? What's going on?
Hello?
Come on.
Who?
_Krueger_...
What happened?
His camera... it's still recording.
What?
It's still on.
Some kind of emergency back at the Sheriff's Station. Four deputies shot... some kind of explosion... I don't know what's going on but they're panicking back there.
What's going on?
Fuck you.
I know how this sounds but that's what happened.
Ruby come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it.  Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?
You're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part.
What?
And we're in the center ring.  You sure you want to wear that blazer?
Quite a circus.
That's my job.
I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges.
I'm not sure I'd call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.
Two.
Did you find a scalpel? Did you find a murder weapon?
And this hand... it... it slashed Doctor Layton's throat... and the Deputy. Then it grabbed Danny by the head...  And it pulled his head right down into his chest... I couldn't... Hayes lays a hand his shoulder.
Jason's. It came out of his chest... a hand with long blades on the fingers...
Who's chest?
That's right... it... it came right out of his chest...
He doesn't look like he's going anywhere Bill. And if necessary I can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private.
Ruby... this guy almost took out an entire Tactical Response Team. You can't expect me to just leave you --
That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.
A house?
Compared to this guy... amateur.
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
Shit. We're still putting the victim list together. You'll need a forklift for the case file. I suggest you hire some help and don't expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months.  You're about to defend the most notorious serial killer in American history.
What are the charges?
Your... client is being booked right now. He'll be in cell five.
Three.  Where's my client?
A seminal film. First ever depiction of a fully nude triple impalement.
"Zombie Sluts From Beyond the Grave."
This is a legitimate cinematic genre. Just like Westerns Comedies Film Noire Science Fiction...
You watch this garbage?
I don't know if anything's going to work in this case. Therefore we have to try everything.
You think that's going to work?
Wrong. Jason can't get a fair trial because of _these_.
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
So... why can't Jason get a fair trial?
Video store?
Now... I think the video store's open for another couple of hours. Let's go.
It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
Sorry.
I think it's our best bet. They're taking apart his house right now... they found weapons blood a mountain of evidence. We can't say he was framed.
Are you going to plead insanity?
My client... is dead.  But I think he's a free man.
What happened? Where's Jason?
For the moment! You've only got about two minutes left! Hurry! Ruby takes off towards the Cineplex...
Are you all right?
Let's split up. You take the left side I'll take the right. We'll meet in front of the Cineplex.
We're down to seven minutes.
If I give you a bigger dose it'll give you a heart attack.
Ten minutes...
About ten minutes.
How long will the effect last?
Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
What's that?
Then we're all in a lot of trouble.
And if he's not?
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal like us.
Think it'll do any good?
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
You know how to use one of those?
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
Where's he going?
Except this victim got away. I wonder if --
If I'm right this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.
Alone... but with a murderous fury inside him... which led him to kill dozens of people.
So Krueger thinks Jason's dead... leaves him in the lake... but the boy actually wakes up on the shore... crawls off into the woods... where he lives the rest of his life alone.
Jason's asleep... maybe he's dreaming of himself as a young boy... and that boy is sitting right here.  I think he's some kind of projection from Jason's subconscious.
How's that possible?
This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.
Checking out a theory. Just keep talking to him.
What are you doing?
A cameraman caught him on videotape. Joe I saw an entire sheriff's squad fighting and losing against an enemy that wasn't there...
You saw him?
It was Krueger wasn't it?
It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  I'm going to need a lot of therapy.
I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow.  They're... digging up some new evidence.
You're not going to be there?
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
Tomorrow. If you can clear it with the Sheriff's department.
Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
Not yet.
I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
So what do we do?
Add it to the list.
That doesn't make sense.
It's as though there were two people in that room... both of them asleep... both of them dreaming.
_It's a second REM pattern_.
Yeah what is it?
See this?
Yeah... I think I understand...  You're drunk too.
Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
Uh-huh...
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream it would kill you in the real world.
I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
Now.... according to the file Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this -- beginning in 1984 there was _another_ series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Krueger's.
Fascinating.
He was a child killer in the late sixties... in a town called Springwood about eight miles from here.  Guess what his murder weapon was? A glove with six-inch blades.
Krueger... doesn't ring a bell.
Well I'm onto something more useful.  You ever hear of a man named Fred Krueger?
Me too. I'm drunk.
I think I'm onto something Joe.
He's my client and this is important. Enjoy your waitresses.
There's nothing to see here. He sleeps... we record it. That's all that happens.
I'll take my chances. Come on I'm buying.
That's open to debate.
Cute waitresses?
There's a pizza place over on Market.
Well that's it. He'll be asleep in a few minutes but his first REM-cycle probably won't kick in for another hour or so.  Is there a place we can get something to eat in this town?
We're going to need at least two full REM cycles to get a clear neurological profile. Three hours minimum six hours ideal.
How long will he need to be asleep?
Then I'd say it's bedtime for Jason.
Simple. We sedate him induce a somnolesent state and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
How do we prove it?
Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
It's a neurological disorder affecting the hypothalamus. The part of the brain that causes sleepiness is inactive. They didn't know about it back in the sixties. Even now it's not understood very well.
Insomnolesence...
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils temperature of one-oh-two blood chemistry highly imbalanced...
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
You're obviously going through a critical moral dilemma. And you're putting up barriers against anyone who tries to probe your conscience.  But it is heartening to know that you do have a conscience.
Oh?
No. You've told me all I need to know.
What do you want -- a tidy psychological profile? You want to hear that I was falsely accused of a crime I didn't commit... and that's driven me to defend others? Or maybe you want to me to get in touch with my feelings... talk about my childhood...
That didn't sound very convincing.
I don't "rationalize" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all.
Don't get me wrong. I don't care. But the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do.
My job is not to determine his guilt or innocence. That's up to the jury. My job is defend him.
So what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
Well Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
None of that's true?
I thought she was a killer too. You know... that she chopped up a bunch of teenage camp counselors... before she was decapitated.
So?
I don't believe it. Jason's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969.
Well I definitely feel sorry for you.  August fourteenth 1956... Jason was brought in by his mother who said the boy hadn't slept for two weeks. Doctor prescribed Valium...
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
Nurses. That's why I went into medicine.
This is Jason Voorhees. They'll be looking for an excuse to send him to the chair.  If we're going to argue insanity we're going to need something a little more concrete.
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
This is bad Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane.
One of the deputies is pretty cute. I think she likes me.
Oh?
I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.
He wets the bed?
Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
Doesnit sleep?
No. When you put me on the stand I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic sociopathic personality.  And he doesn't sleep.
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
He's fucking nuts.
Well?
Yeah stick around you might learn something.
You mind if I ride with you?
Or worse we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.
Alright we know who we're looking for.  Play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again.
If you guys want in fine.  Just remember this is our jurisdiction.
Every step of the way.
Cooperate?
I'm sure if our departments cooperate we can find out the truth.
That's the point.  He slipped up and he's desperate now.  And that means he's all the more dangerous.
If what you're saying is true then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
Our agency monitors all threats very carefully and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training the connections and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage but the charges were later dropped and he sprang the service.
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31 no priors and he's been working for the military for ten years.
Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
What can I do for you?
Yeah?
Captain Doyle?
Alright stay on the phone.
What do you think?
You set to go -
We're by Ozone...
Where are you?
Yeah?
No I mean ours motherfucker! If I go down everyone's going with me - you and your crew especially! You won't get protection you won't get the trucks - nothing!
You mean shut your ass down!
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
So what?
He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
The shit just hit the fan brother. That bitch has a partner and he got away from me.
What do you need?
It's Marvosa -
Well why don't you sit this one and get some rest...you look like shit. CUT TO INT TUBBS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
It's just...catching up with me you know?
Something wrong with you Marvosa?
That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?
Outside hacker?  What the fuck are you talking about?
Hey what they did on their time was their business you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag wherever he is.
Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker you know some connection.
Where do you come from Marvosa?
Gotta come from somewhere...
It's kind of a funny coincidence isn't it?
What?
Well don't you think that's odd?
Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -
Yeah...
Did you start out area six?
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
When did you join the force?  You know the police force the place you work...
What?
Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
What's this?
Fine -
I'll take the south end -
I'm sure you can handle it.  Now I want to do an alley-to alley sweep beginning at the north and south ends from Marine to 30th.  Foot beat units continue on the boardwalk.
These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
Right behind you.
Let's roll -
Fine...
Find out for me.
I don't know shit.  Maybe she was looking for love...
But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
What did the six-toes have to say?
I didn't hit shit!
Did you hit him?
Don't worry -
Don't take any chances.  Call for back-up this time!
We're all gonna fan out!  C'mon let's do a sweep of the alleys -
I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
Great. Well that changes a lot...
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
What the hell is this Marvosa!!
Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--
I don't know how you're used to doing things Marvosa but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!
It happened too fast.  He was in the back quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking Jesus!!!
He busted the back window with his feet and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
What the hell happened?
we've got kidnapping grand theft auto burglary and two counts of murder on you and I'm gonna see to it personally that it sticks!
You can cut the shit asshole--
Did you report it stolen?
Bullshit...
It wasn't in the cards.
I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop...
I'll live...
Are you alright?
Yeah it was opened -  with a goddamn screwdriver!!!
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
So...  to get the car back you break into her house.
She stole my car!!
I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
And who are you?
Alright where is she?
Nothing!  He didn't do nothing!
And what did he do to the girl?
I was just having a little fun -
Alright alright!  We were just fucking with him..you know?
Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers you got that!!
Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
Hell he probably raped her in the lot dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
Did he harm the girl?
Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
And he took a swing at you?
The guy was looking for trouble shoving people around being an asshole...
Well let's get his ass to the garage!  Some lead...
He said he was following up some lead.
And where the hell is Marvosa?
Could explain why Fleming was there.
Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
Well it's just kind of a coincidence isn't it?  Stanton and Fleming both started in '83 both in area six...both in Vice?
Something I don't already know?
Well read this -
No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
Did you read today's paper?
That's great Zydowski you tech guys are really on the ball.  Harding - call the print lab at the FBI run the prints through their library see if it's less screwed-up than ours...
That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
What?  Wait a minute -
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field convicted for soliciting two years ago.
Yeah?
You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
Zydowski.  It's about time.
LAPD data center reports a breach on the system.  An outside hacker has accessed files on Detectives Fleming and Stanton...and yours too Marvosa.
Yeah?
Captain?
Good! We'll get it to the nearest outlying station and hold it for prints - we're on our way -  You coming?
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
Speak of the devil.
I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
Where is he?!!
I don't know - but he's from the FBI.
Who is it?
Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
Neither did I.  I'll make it up to you I promise...
No -
Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?
Where the hell is my car?
Yeah.
There's something I've been meaning to ask you Stephanie.
So you know about Marvosa and Stanton and all of them.
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
What happened with the tape?
I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.
What did you do then?
I had it all on tape...
Found what?
And what did you do?
Yeah...they did.  One girl...
Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
I was there and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
No but I'm listening.
Six months ago a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note you may have heard of it...
What exactly did you see?
No.  A witness.
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
Why did you set me up?
You'll find out - soon enough.
What's going on here?
Only on dates?
No.
You always carry a gun with you?
Figure you would have tried it already.
You know you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?
No...
Mind if I turn out the light?
You're the mysterious type right?
No...
You got any family?
Seattle.
Where up north?
Up north.
So where are you from?
Don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.
Are you going to be alright?
I'm going to need a way to get there.
I can't help you anymore Jimmy. I'm sorry.
I told you I'm not going anywhere! I got my whole life in this place!  I'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb.
Tubbs these people mean business.
I'm not going anywhere!
That was her - the girl... We have to go.
Shit we just started.  But I better log out of this.
It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
Ahh shit.  We're pretty much tapped out.  I'm getting denied access all over the place...
And look at the balances...these aren't police salaries...
Both at the same bank...
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
A bank?
OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas.  And that's Switzerland's country code.
What else is new?
You know this time there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time.
I gave all that up.  I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment.  It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore...  ...some things never change I guess.
So...what happened to you Jimmy?  I figure you'd be in some far off place somewhere living on the edge like the good old days.
I'll access the LAPD mainframe but we gotta be careful - that one's kind of tricky -
How about Marvosa and the others?
OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.
I got a lot of free time you know what I mean?
I knew I could count on you.
I don't but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
Donut?
Let's see what we got...
1490...Breckinridge...
OK I'm logged on to the municipal network.  I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county.  None of them live in Hollywood.  Do you remember the address?
OK...where do you want to start?
I've got a better idea...
Shit what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
Alright...alright...you've saved my ass enough times.  What do you want to do?
I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
Oh man...what happened?
I have nowhere else to go Tubbs I need your help!
Shit you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
They're inside the department they're everywhere - it's not safe.
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
It was self-defense Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something I don't know what -
Jimmy do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -
Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
Oh shit shit shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
I killed them.
And?...
Look Jimmy you know I haven't seen you in eight years you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!
No...
Yeah c'mon in...you scared the hell out of me!
Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?
Holy shit -

Just what did you get yourself into Jimmy?
Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
You are drunk.  You know it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up but I really got to -

Not with this...
You don't seem afraid of much.
Screw him!
What would your - boyfriend - think?
Bartender said there are motels south of here.
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
Ditched you?
Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
Are you a regular there?
Well you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
Hop in.
I'm stranded out here.
Mind if I come along for the ride?
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
You must be going somewhere.
Well I've kind of had my fill of the place you know what I mean?
Where are you going?
County jail - get in.
Where am I going?
Then what did you do play canasta?
No.  It wasn't like that!
Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
What?
Did you have sex with her?
No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
Nahhh...
Yeah and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me go ahead...
Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
Long gone huh?
Long gone... MARVOSA Well you won't mind if I don't take your word for it right?
Where is he?
Don't you guys ever knock?
