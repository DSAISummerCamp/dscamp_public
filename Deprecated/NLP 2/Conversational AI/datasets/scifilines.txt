When I asked Evan about his drawing well he didn't remember doing it.
What?
Of course. There is one more thing Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did but this...
What is it?
I was going to show this to the principal but I wanted to talk to you first.
I'm sorry but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
No dances just tell me.
So what did you find.
Actually these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
Nine ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes dammit!
Evan wake up oh please wake up!
How soon?...
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason some security you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck no more missing father complex.
Well he has been pushing me to meet his father but I've been putting it off.
You'd be surprised how often they are.
Come on I doubt the answer's that simple.
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
If I had to guess I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
But you must have something to go on?
Unfortunately we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
And the bad news?
Well the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions hemorrhaging tumors...
It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days.
Why? What for?
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
Anything.
Look Andrea I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...
Hold it hold it Andrea. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'll run some preliminary tests see what we can rule out.
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
Just. Like. Jason.
You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait that wasn't me. Or you.
How. Did you. Know that?
Come on Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
You're. Acting. Like your father.
I just need the entry about the blockbuster. Wait shit no arms. I never even got the chance to write it.
Fix?
There must be a way to fix this.
He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it doc?
What does that mean for Evan?
Cute Evan.
Okay doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got?
Fine. You'll get them Evan. But I think it's far more important to focus on your case right now.
Damn it Mom. I told you I need them all!
I found these. The others are still in storage.
How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
I don't know. These things take time.
How long will I be in here?
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense so if you're patient.
What? What could he do?
And then just before it got so bad that he had to be committed he said that he could...
Sure...
I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know he might only have thought he actually remembered them...
When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past.
No it's just weird with him being such a brain and all I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
Why do you ask?
Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
Please mom. People will talk.
Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
I... I blacked out.
Something must've happened! What set him off?
I don't know... I don't remember.
Okay.
Now your father may seem sleepy to you but that's just because of his medicine okay?
I... I don't remember.
Honey. What were you doing with that?
What happened?
Great. I'll see you soon.
These'll bring you luck Crockett.
My father has a bad memory too?
That's why I wanted you to come here Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
I don't like this place Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
No.
I get the point kiddo. But I'm not so bad am I?
All the dads are gonna be there.
But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
Can't he come out for one day?
You know the answer to that.
Um... can dad come this time?
Darn it!
Thanks. Don't worry Evan you'll have plenty of time.
Righty-tighty lefty-lucy.
We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
We're gonna be late again.
So you believe me?
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
What did you see? What did it look like?
Marks scars I dunno. Anything could happen I guess.
Weirder than this?
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
You need to see the prison shrink man.
So when I'm out I need you to watch my face and hands closely.
I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Straight up.
You're religious Carlos you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?"
Jesus himself couldn't make me take on the Brotherhood. When they come just put your mind in another place man. Be somewhere else.
Can you protect me?
Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.
Photos?
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
But I... I need those books.
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges prisons paraplegia...
My journals! Where are they?
Books?
Where are my goddamn books?
Hey Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored?
This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
Are you sure? Not even with my father?
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
It's coming... argh! I can't!
The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember this is only a movie. You're completely safe.
I see a car.
Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
No protecting her.
Are you hurting her?
I'm standing next to Kayleigh my hands are over her ears.
Where are you now?
Yes.
Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause rewind or slow down any details you wish. Understand?
Not in this wing actually. No.
Dad lives here?
You know my father?
Hello Evan. It's very nice to meet you.  He's as handsome as his father.
Sorry dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
Get out. Both of you.
Fuck off frat boy.
Huh?
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
Shucks I dunno. But maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities dammit!
What?
Are you stupid or what?
Shhh! I need quiet for this.
What the fuck are you doing?
I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --
All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
You really think he wanted to kill you?
That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure it gets all of the worm's memories.
Like Ozzy.
It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls getting lost whatever.
This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts.
I thought you were a December baby.
Get dressed Thumper you're taking me out for my birthday.
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
Then you think it might have worked out?
Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we relatively stable relationships matching burial plots the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
And...?
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
When my folks split they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
I don't get it.
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
I was?
Sure Evan why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
Yeah I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
Is something the matter?
He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please the twisted fuck.
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
Stop! Take me back!
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
Where are we going?
Well don't give up now Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family.
I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
Off to change everyone's life again is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
Sure you don't want your wallet?
There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin' sorority.
Which is?
There's one major hole in your story.
That I didn't leave you there to rot.
Know what?
I just thought you should know.
Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you it reminds you of your step-sister.
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
Oh? There's proof now?
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now and why I never will again.
You're right Evan I don't believe you.
Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
Yeah?
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
Different? How?
Because you're... different.
Why's that?
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore especially in your case.
You wouldn't believe me. I mean people always say "You wouldn't believe me" but in this case it's not even worth trying.
What's happened to you?
The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
Ha! Where's that?
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
Oh I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable precious?
I get it. You can drop it now.
So how's tricks? Sorry occupational humor.
Nice to see you too. Can I come in?
Oh I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast I'm expecting someone.
Now's the only time!  Today you get a chance to redeem yourself. Start over with a clean slate. Tabula rasa --
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
I want you to take this Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --
He's a fucking maniac!
Evan stop! You're gonna kill him!
What?
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
I can't put my finger on it but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful but...
I walk differently?
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
Like how?
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange you know?
What do you mean?
Are you okay?
My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit because you turned out fine.
It's not his fault Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
Yeah right. Tell that to Crockett.
Please Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
Might'a been nice.  Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
Why are you doing all this for me?
Go on. Sit down.
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
You'll see.
I don't understand where are you taking me?
As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like looking back whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away?
Yeah if you call multiple orgasms weird.
So it didn't feel... weird?
Oh my God that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
I dunno.  Just being weird.
Well I remember he had one... but he like put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
Hey uh don't go freaking out on me over this but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?
Those are your clothes silly.
Where... where are my clothes?
Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
Jesus Kayleigh you're...  Incredible.
Who are you trying to convince Evan?! You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? Well fuck you Evan! Nothing's gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better!
You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
Just shut up Evan. You're wasting your breath.
No but I think something really bad might've happened to us.
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
I know but...
It was a long time ago.
It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
What do you want to know Evan?
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
Well sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
Well lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
Of course.
Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
Actually Kayleigh the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever.
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Not if you remember my dad.
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
So how's Tommy?
I've stopped a hundred times.
Not since we were kids.
I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good...
No Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
Oh comme si comme ca you know...
God Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
Hi Lenny.
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
He must be. They're letting him go right?
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
Duck here they come.
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away right?
What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.
I deserve a lot worse.
Damn. Your dad did this?
It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
I'm sorry.
Ouch.
You really don't remember anything that happened?
I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea.
Shit Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
Oh God... what did we do?
So let's go. This place creeps me out.
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here we're dead.
Been there done that.
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
Easy does it Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
Listen close then fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you.
...yes.
Let's just say you're being closely watched George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you Papa?
Who -- who are you?
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work daddy.
What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
Wrong answer fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
What time is it?
Kayleigh? What happened?
Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been.
I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here?
Calm down kid. Stand still.
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?
That's right Evan and you get to be the star.
We're really gonna be in a movie!?
Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
You can't play God son. It must end with me. Just by being here you may be killing your mother.
Who's to say you can't make things better?
There is no "right". When you change who people are you destroy who they were.
But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
I was praying this curse would have ended with me.
Look Jason I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me right?
I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
Thanks. Wow. Hey I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
Damn Evan on the D.L.
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
Me neither.
We'll find out soon enough.
Evan you're hysterical. You study for this?
The answer's 'no' Mr. Treborn. Now take a seat. The exam's about to begin.
Evan Treborn.
And you are...?
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
Remember everyone! Only two weeks until your science projects are due.
I won't let you down Professor Carter.
Just don't drop the ball okay?
I know I know. Who can think of worms when your libido's in full swing right?
Oh fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up so I haven't...
Whoa! Didn't mean to scare you Evan. Just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
Hey I got no choice.
Typical psych major. A complete wise ass. And how's your project coming? Still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan you pass out on all your dates?
It didn't feel like a dream.
It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
Come on go on...
Deal. Now read me something.
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm and no Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something okay?
Wow... read something.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Most guys tuck their porn under here but all you have are... comp books.
You're kidding. He's so... big.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Smells like sex in here.
Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.
So what's the point?
If I hadn't blown my arms off Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.
Destroy it?
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
What?
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see.
Are you sure you even packed it?
Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
Uh we should be getting to class now.
Y... yes. I guess I did.
You knew the whole time didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!
Drop it or I'll slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
Yeah good what else do you remember?
I couldn't cut the rope.
Gee thanks friend.
That should buy you ten minutes at least.
Sure. I was gonna make a new one anyway.
Can... can... Can I have this?
I think I'll go check out the chapel.
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
Sorry Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
Lung cancer?
Oh goody nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
I did what you said man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.
I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
Listen to me good Evan...
Right Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
No one thinks you're a piece of shit Tommy.
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
What the hell are you doing?
Get this "us" shit. As if I was gonna lay a hand on my own sister. You've done nicely for yourself Evan. Nice friends nice life not to mention you're fucking my sister. Not a bad piece of ass if I say so myself.
Leave us alone you sick fuck!
What's wrong with you?!
Look what you made me do!
What happened?? Where are we?!
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up Evan! Come on!
Hold your horses man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
Tommy I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
Fat little baby crying for mommy.
Hey what'd you do that for?
Sorry. Never heard of her.
None taken. Hey uh does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
Meant no offense.
I come from a big family.
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
Huh?
Just get out didja?
Aw hey now that was a compliment.
Shut up Tommy!
Oh my God oh my God...
Lenny? Come on!
I'm sorry.
Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
Just blow something up? Are you nuts? There's an art to mass destruction. Would you just paint the Mona Lisa? No. Besides we're here already.
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
You are silly. He's a bad sheriff.
I thought I was the bad guy!
Quit it Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
Evan guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
Yeah you do that Lenny.
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
Ain't gonna work this time buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it you'll puss out and narc for sure.
What? No frigging way man. I'm not touching that thing.
Here you go buddy.
You're such a retard!
You put the mommy too far away. Mrs. Boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
Now that's what I like to hear!  Because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears. They give in to their feelings of self-doubt... they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs alcohol and premarital sex. Empty solutions. These are toxic chemicals... and disease-spreading behaviour.
GOOD MORNING!
Are you AFRAID?
GOOD MORNING!
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
Good MORNING!
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said "Good morning!"
Good morning...
Good morning mongrels!
Did you know him?
Yeah.
I feel bad for his family.
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
What was his name?
He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
What happened?
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
Hi... what's going on here?
Donnie I'm afraid I can't continue this conversation. I could lose my job.
Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
You are contradicting yourself Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
If you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach you could see into the future. And that's a form of time travel right?
I'm not following you.
If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
Could these wormholes appear in nature?
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal in this case the wormhole or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
Beg pardon?
Like a spear.
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
Did you stop and think that maybe infants need darkness? That darkness is part of their natural development.
Well... the thing is nobody remembers their infancy. And anyone who says they do is lying. We think that this would help develop memory earlier in life.
What effect do you think this would have on an infant?
A metal craft of any kind.
Like a DeLorean.
The basic principles of time travel are there.  So you have the vessel and the portal. And the vessel can be anything. Most likely a spacecraft.
So... that's it?
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge which is theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
Theoretically.
So... in order to travel back in time you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
I know that this is gonna sound kinda weird... but do you know anything about time travel?
Donnie.
Dr. Monnitoff?
Donnie! Give it back!
"The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko.
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this Samantha?
I'm telling Mom.
When you fall asleep tonight I'm gonna fart in your face.
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
Not until like... eighth grade.
When can I squeeze one out?
Our saviour...
What did you say?
Dea ex machina...
You know what? I think that you did it.
Well if you're innocent then you have nothing to worry about.
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
I didn't say shit.
Did you tell them that I flooded the school?
You should already know that.  Watch the movie Donnie. I have something to show you.
How much longer is this gonna last?
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
Why do they call you Frank?
I am so sorry.
What happened to your eye?
Take it off. I want to see you.
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
Yeah. Tell me why you're wearing that stupid bunny suit.
You have a request?
You have to do something for me first.
I want to show you something.
Do you believe in time travel Donnie?
Where did you come from?
You'll know soon enough.
Who is... we?
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
Why did you make me flood the school?
I can do anything I want... and so can you...
How can you do that?
Go home. Go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine.
What'd you do Donnie? What'd you do!
A hundred and one I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.
How old is Grandma Death?
I don't wanna talk about it.
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
We went to a hotel.
DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you like a jillion times last night!
Yeah...
Is that a cellar door?
Who's Frank?
No. Frank.
Why? Is this about the book?
Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
Where are we going?
Come with me.
There's something you have to know Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
What?
It's safe here.
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
Yeah they told me to get out of the house.
Did you call the cops?
But you're OK?
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
Where is she?
My mom is gone.
Hey. You OK?
Hey.
Then when? I have to talk to you.
Not now Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Will you please talk to me?
What do you mean?
What's wrong with you?
You want to skip fourth period and go to the Ridge?
The whole movie. Let's go.
What? How long was I asleep?
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant and they wear them at night when they sleep.
Infant Memory Generators.
So we call them... IMGs.
Maybe she's asleep.
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.
She wrote it.  There are chapters in this book that describe the stuff I've been seeing. It can't just be a coincidence.  Will you come see her with me?
Oh yeah.  "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
The old crazy woman who lives off Old Gun Road.
Who?
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
Are you okay?
They suspended me for two days.
What?
We're moving through time.
Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
I always wanted it to be at a time when... when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be.
No... Donnie wait. I've never...
That's alright... I understand.
You want to kiss me...
Well...
And what?
You know... we've been going together for a week and a half...
Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.
With like images?
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like perpetual darkness.
I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?
What happened to your neck?
Well... maybe someone is like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way.
Why?
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
Yeah?
Donnie?
And you'd never been there before?
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
So when you sleepwalk you go somewhere familiar?
It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
My dad said never wake a sleepwalker... because they could drop dead.
No. I just wake up and I look around try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
So when you sleepwalk can you remember afterward? Like do you dream?
I'm going home.
Where are you going?
Sure.
No... I mean will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
Where are we going?
Will you go with me?
That was a compliment.
I'm sorry.
You're weird.
We never would have had this conversation.
Why is that?
It's a good thing the school was flooded today.
Until it withers away.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
Wonder where we'll be then.
Don't knock soap. Without it disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
You mean soap?
I mean the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation especially in medicine.
That's easy. Antiseptics.
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
What makes you think I'm not?
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know change things.
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
Wow. Did he go to jail?
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
Oh I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
So... you just moved here?
Fuck them.
I'm not. But you should check your backpack 'cause those guys like to steal shit.
Don't look so freaked.
Sure.
Wanna walk me home?
School's cancelled.
Hey...
Hey...
If you don't complete the assignment you'll get a zero for the day.
People aren't that simple.
Well yeah... OK but you're not listening to me. There are other things that need to be taken into account here. Like the whole spectrum of human emotion. You're just lumping everything into these two categories... and like denying everything else.
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
Well life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
The Lifeline is divided that way.
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
I'm sorry Ms. Farmer I just don't get this.
It feels wonderful.
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
Do you get to meet Ed?
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.
Fine. You know Dr. Thurman isn't so bad a lady. I can tell her anything.
He can't Samantha. He's been suspended from after-school activities. Donnie... are you still with us?  How was your therapy session tonight?
That is a terrible nickname.
Grandma Death.
Then why don't you start taking the goddamn pills?
You know... it would be nice to look at you some time... and see my son. I don't recognise this person today.
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade Mom.  Get out of my room.
I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
Oh please tell me Elizabeth how exactly does one suck a fuck?
When did you stop taking your medication?
You're such a fuck-ass.
No a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
I know I'm not the best... communicator.  But whatever happens in your life... whatever obstacles you come up against... you just say... and do whatever is in your heart. You be honest... and tell the truth... even if they look at you funny... and they will. They'll tell you that you're wrong. They'll call you a fool.  But what you've got to understand son is that almost all of those people are full of bullshit... and they're scared of people like you. Because you're smarter than all of them.
I know Dad.
You're my only son...
A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
Who's been giving you weird looks?
I guess she just lost faith in the world.
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
You know Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day.
Grandma Death.
Grandma Death.
Oh shit!
You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
Where it came from?
Know what?
Do they know yet?
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
So how was school today?
Then go find her Donnie. Don't let her get away.  She was right about the rabbits. Go.
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door?
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
Cellar door.
A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that "Cellar Door" is the most beautiful.
What's "Cellar Door"?
Tell them that everything is going to be just fine.  It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue.
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
Thank you Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others you question Mom and Dad's rules.
That's bullshit. You're a good teacher.
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
Where are you going?
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends scaring old people?
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
Because the rabbits are us Donnie.
Why should we care?
And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision do they believe him?  It could be the death of an entire way of life the end of an era.
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
Who is Frank?
Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
Donnie Darko perhaps given your recent brush with mass destruction you can give us your opinion?
Goodbye Donald.
Goodbye Dr. Thurman.
Donald an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
Thank you.
Your medication. They're placebos. Just pills made out of water.
You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together you will wake up.
It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends there will only be you and him... and no one else.
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
Where is he Donald?
I can see him right now!
Who is he going to kill?
Frank is going to kill.
What is going to happen?
Soon. Time is almost up.
When will this happen?
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
Then how is time travel possible?
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
How is that possible?
I have the power to build a time machine.
Where are we going Donald?
Where are we going?
I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
God exists because you're horny.
Because I'm so horny.
Why?
I think now that he might...
If God exists?
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
Why did you do these things Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
You've done it again?
That I did it again.
What else makes you feel regret?
Regret.
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
What did you want for Christmas that year?
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
Yes. I went to jail.
But you were punished.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
People get hurt.
Is it Frank who wants you to destroy the world to set the world on fire?
I... I was playing with fire.
So your parents... why did you disappoint them?
Yes.
And when I clap my hands together twice you will wake up. Do you understand?
Have you ever made love Donald?
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
The good stuff.
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's like waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
I know.
Whoa.  That's OK Dr. Thurman it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.
You know... every week I come in here and I tell you stuff... and it's all embarrassing. I tell you stuff that I don't tell anyone else... and you know what? It's your turn Dr. Thurman. I'm not saying anything else until you tell me something embarrassing about yourself.
Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
Yeah but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
Nothing.
What did you find?
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
And they grow out of our stomachs?
No. That makes you keep searching.
I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's like I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd.  I don't want to be alone.  So does that make me like an atheist?
Do you feel alone right now?
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
Is Callie still around?
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
How does that make you feel?
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
A sign from whom?
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
Can anyone else see him?
Four times... so far.
How many times have you seen Frank?
Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.
No I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
What about your family Donnie?
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
Who is the boss?
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
What else do you think about during school?
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
I asked you about school.
I think about girls a lot.
How are things going at school?
Yes.
Do you think a lot about girls?
Gretchen. We're going together now.
What is her name?
I met a girl.
So tell me about your day Donald.
Yes.
And when I clap my hands twice you will wake up. Do you understand?
No.  That's stupid.
Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?
Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
Follow him where?
He said to follow him.
Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.
A jet engine fell on my house... landed on my bed. While I was talking to Frank on the golf course.
I don't own a television.
Don't you watch the news?
How so?
I think he saved my life.
Frank.
His name is Frank.
Would you like to talk about this friend?
So I met a new friend.
All of this... certainly isn't your mother's fault Donald.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know abuse her. Psychologically.
Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
Everything is going to be just fine.
Okay but it has to be a small one.
Mom and Dad won't be back until Sunday night. It's Halloween Carnival. We should throw a party. We could totally get away with it.
Congratulations.
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
That's a nice name.  OK let me see it.
Her name is Gretchen.
Yeah... well that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
I was just being honest.
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer I laughed my ass off.
Well don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
No I don't.  She worries about you.
Because you tell Mom everything.
Why would I tell Mom?
You're not gonna tell Mom are you?
What's her name?
Yeah.
So I hear you have a girlfriend.
Guess who wrote it?
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
It's called "The Philosophy of Time Travel".
Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
Whoa Elizabeth. A little hostile there. Maybe you should be the one in therapy. Then Mom and Dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts... so we won't have to.
Well I think you're the fucking Anti-Christ.
I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.
Well Jim I think you're full of shit!
Well Gerald I think you're afraid.
Gerald.
Excuse me? What's your name son?
How much are they paying you to be here?
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
If that's what you think is necessary.
I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.
I... What can we do?
He has described lengthy conversations... physical encounters with what I believe to be a manifestation of his subconscious mind.
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
Frank?
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Come again?
Has your son ever told you about Frank?
Well you know about his past. And when you said to look for signs of aggression... He was recently suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher.
What I think is going on with your son.
Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...
He died remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.
He was a year ahead of us?
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
What?
You are entering a new dimension of sight and sound...
So let me get this straight. No airline will claim ownership of the engine. So we have to wait for the FAA to decide who fixes my roof.  Fuck that. We're taking the money out of savings.
You're not a bitch.
Our son just called me a bitch.
Don't worry Mom. Just go you'll miss your flight.
Here are the keys to the Taurus. There's plenty of groceries in the fridge. And I left money on the kitchen table. And don't forget...
I caught him flushing pills down the toilet. He knows you check the container.
It is a big deal.
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
How did you know --
No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?
You can suck a fuck.
That's enough.
Did you just call me a fuck-ass?
Donnie? You're a dick.
Excuse me?
If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out then I think you're misinformed.
I haven't been accepted yet mother.
I guess they made him do it.
How did this happen?
Yep.
Christ. Is that an axe?
What else? Shit Principal Cole you ain't gonna believe what else.
What else?
I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
Rose... I don't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters. This has been a dream of ours for a long time.  Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.
Oh Kitty I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
Yes. And believe me of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
But now you can't go.
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
Beg pardon?
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
Yes I saw the news. Something about a kiddie-porn dungeon.
Rose we have a crisis.  I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
Kitty...
Rose.
Rose I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.
Kitty I don't know what to say. They've suspended him for two days.  Ever since this jet fiasco I honestly don't know what has gotten into him.
I think we've all seen "Bonanza".
Do you even know who Graham Greene is?
The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism.
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!
The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour.
Kitty...
Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
Kitty I would appreciate... if you could wait...
I stole four beers from my dad.
We got eggs water balloons and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
Not Vanity. He's a homo.
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
No more fuckin' for her.
Wicked.
Raspberry.
What is this shit?
Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.
All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes you're supposed to go straight home.
There's no rule!
You know there's like this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
Go back to China bitch!
Chut up!
No one.
Who was the girl you walked off with?
I told you that later.
Yeah you told me that later.
This is the night you met Clementine Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought oh shit.
I remember.
I did. You said things were fine.
I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.
Just a little overworked maybe.
I'm sorry Naomi couldn't make it. You okay? You seem quiet.
Say hi to Naomi.
Yeah.
I hope you feel better sweetie.
Thanks guys.
Sweetie we called the company.
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
You weren't supposed to see that.
I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.
She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
I don't know honey. It's horrible.
Hi Joel. So no jokes about my name?
No it was lovely.
You did? You liked me?
And I just liked you so much.
But I don't know maybe we're the normal ones y'know? I mean what kind of people do well at this stuff?
But I thought I don't know I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
Anyhoo sweetie I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
Shit. The last time I saw you.
Here we are.
Okay I guess.
How are you today?
Hi.
Ms. Kruczynski?
Yes please have a seat. He'll be right with you.
Yeah hi I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
May I help you?
Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
What's wrong with me?
It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
I'm excited too. Oh and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
I'm so excited. Yay!
Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
Um okay. I'll call my study partner.
Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
Come up to Boston with me?
Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
Oh Tangerine.
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
Oh baby what's going on?
In the world.
In the room?
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
I really want to but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
You rat.
I can't. I want to but I have to study.
Come over after I'm done here?
I was not.
You were not.
I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood.
I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
Maybe gay isn't the right word. But anyway it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level I want to break it off but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is I'm not getting any younger I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think no this is what I really want so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
Well I've been having a bad time of it with um my boyfriend I guess.
Well why don't you tell me what's going on? Do you mind if I turn this on?
Okay I guess.
How are you today?
I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
I can't stop thinking about you.
You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock."
We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
Says you were a slob leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
Doesn't sound like me.
I don't know.
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
Says you would sometimes disappear all night then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
Well sounds like me. Sorry man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
That's what it says. You drank too much you picked on me for being passive and timid.
A bully? Moi?
Says you were a bully...
Says you were closed off non communicative never told me what you were feeling.
I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you.
Well you obviously don't know me.
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
I'm nervous too.
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
Hey Joel --
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
That's okay. I --
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
Oh um...
Have sex. Y'know --
Make love?
Listen did you want to make love?
Joel come here. Please.
I think I should go back.
What if?
I don't know. What if it breaks?
I don't know.
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
Yeah.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
Tomorrow?
When?
Yeah.
So you'll call me right?
I love you.
Bye Joel.
Come back and make up a good-bye at least. Let's pretend we had one.
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
What if you stay this time?
I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire trying to outrun my humiliation. You said "so go" with such disdain.
So go.
No it's our house! Just tonight --  -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible.  Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment.
I think we should go.
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles matches and the liquor cabinet.
Naomi.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
It's dark.
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
I knew.
I could see you wanted to come in Joel.
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
C'mon man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.
It's freezing out here.
What are you doing?
Cool.
At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree.
Female.
Male or female?
Oh.
I do sort of live with somebody though.
Let's move into this neighborhood.
Um no.
I wish we did. You married?
Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it.  Look houses in which we don't live.
Yeah yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind/And a house in which we don't live...
Yeah maybe.
Seems too coincidental that way.
I think before.
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
Me too. There's this poem --
I think she's great.
Really? Me too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
I love her.
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
Okay.
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
yeah?
You should try Xanax. I mean it's a chemical and all but it works... and it works just having it around knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
No I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
What do we do?
I know.
This is it Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.
Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic.
Yeah like that.
You mean like...  Oh my darlin' oh my darlin' oh my darlin' Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
I'm Joel.
Oh God how horrid.
And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
You said --
Yeah I know. I'm fishing.
You know what I did.
Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable but yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought thank God someone normal who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
You said...
Hi.
Hi there.
Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.
It would be different if we could just give it another go around.
I know.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
Probably.
You had the whole human race pegged.
I had you pegged didn't I?
I remember that speech really well.
Joel I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.
So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
Okay.
Look man I'm telling you right off the bat I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me you're with me.
Not yet. Not married.
Well you're married.
I'd like to... take you out or something.
Yeah?
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away after all.
I did it. I guess that means something.
Is that what you want?
I told her today I need to end it.
Yes exactly. Exactly my point.
It's very late.
Come up and see me... now.
I dropped you off after. You said --
And I didn't have an argument.
So what. Infatuation is good too.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't think of anything to say. There were long silences.
But you weren't. I could tell.
I'm sure I said.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
We did talk about Naomi.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
Right. Something black though.
No! I think you were wearing that black dress y'know with the buttons.
Egad were you horrified?
God I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
What was I wearing?
Yeah.
Naomi I guess.
Do you remember what we talked about?
This is our first "date" date.
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
Yeah.
I'm done Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.
I love it!
I scoured the city for it.
Thanks Joely. A present! Oh boy!
Happy Birthday.
I don't like it either but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --
Joel!
This kid Joe Early is going to beat the shit out of me.
Look at you cutey! What are we doing?
Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
Yes but I can't love a man named Wally.
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
But can't you see... I love you Antoine.
Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm like so freaked out now.
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
Really? Is he cute?
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
What?
There's this guy!
-- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?
I came over to the bed and you smelled so good like you just woke up slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
You remember what happened next?
I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.
You know we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
Joel Joely look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
I'm right here.
I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you Clem.
Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in what if you take me to a memory I'm not in?  And we can hide there till morning.
What do you mean?
What if you hide me?
I don't know.
Wow. Um well... can't you just force yourself awake?
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
Oh?
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you Clem!
Such a beautiful view.
It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.  I can't believe I'm crying already. He says "It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real most of your hair has been loved off and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all because once you are Real you can't be ugly except to people who don't understand."
No.
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
Yeah Tangerine?
Joely...
No. Thanks.
More?
Joel you're a liar.
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
I want to know you.
No it isn't that.
You don't tell me things Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.
You're a whiz kid. So perceptive so --
You're drunk.
Would you get me another Joely?
So um --
It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
Oh thank God. It's going.
I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother!
Clem I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
Joel We're fucking gonna talk about it!
I don't want to talk about this here.
What?!
Clementine do you really think you could take care of a kid?
You're not ready.
I don't think we're ready.
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
Let's talk about it later.
I want to have a baby.
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
Where are you going?
How can you watch this crap?
Look at it out here. It's falling apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy.
Fuck you Joel. Faggot.
Let me drive you home.
No see Clem I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
A wino? Jesus Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you and in your little wormy brain you're trying to figure out did she fuck someone tonight?
Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something.
I don't know maybe you did kill somebody.
Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
It's three.
Yo ho ho!
You didn't say anything about my hair.
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
Okay.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
Tomorrow?
When?
Yeah.
You'll call me right?
So I enjoyed meeting you.
Yes.
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
Okay.
I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow so...
You should stay.
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
Yeah? Oh great!
Okay.
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
I think so.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
That's scary sounding.
That made me cry. But anyway we went up to Boston because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
Oh yeah.
Well for the last week anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball but he's really stuck on me which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's like a dope but he says these smart and moving things sometimes out of nowhere that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know if I don't love my body then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  So I've been seeing this guy...
No not at all.
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
No.
You're very nice. God I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me huh?
Yeah.
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
What's the goal Joel?  My goal Joel is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die because you stop listening to what is true and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
Yeah.
And anyway you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
Thanks.
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God I'm an idiot.
I think about that.
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed aren't you?
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
Yeah I guess.
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like okay but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying right? You forget about those times. Right?
Yeah I don't know. It's hard to know.
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions so I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know you think something and then it happens or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
I don't know.
Well I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
Yeah?
Y'know I'm sort of psychic.
Drink up young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
Thanks.
I know a man who needs a refill.
No. I --
No stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
Well I should probably get going.
I don't know! I can't see them from here Joel! Just pick something good.
You just say. I'm not really --
You pick it.
What do you want to hear?
No I'm okay for now.
Ready for another?
Yeah? Well have a seat anyway.
I'm fine.
God that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
Cheers.
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway cheers!
It's pretty.
Yeah. I'm not like a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
Frost?
Me neither. Oh there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
I don't know.
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
Thanks. That was good that crow sound.
This... someone gave that to me just like recently. I like it too. I like crows. I think I used to be a crow.
Very much.
You like that?
Never mind. Sorry that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night Joel.
Um --
Hey do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
Take care.
Oh geez I'm full of shit. I already told you that.  Anyway. See Ya.
Well I wouldn't want to be --
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
I'm just a bit of a wreck. "I sleep in your hat" makes me cry.  Me.
What?
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
Sort of um...
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
Me too. It is Rain Dogs by the way.
I like to read.
So you like bookstores huh?
It's okay. I didn't think you were.
Look I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
Wilmont. Near the high school.
Yeah.
You know Wilmont?
I'm not a stalker.
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
Well I probably wouldn't say if I were but no.
You're not a stalker or anything right?
Where do you live?
Yeah?
It's okay.
I don't want to take you out of your way.
You're sure? It's cold.
No that's okay. Thanks though.
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
Probably see you at the book store.
Oh okay. Well sure I'll just...  Take care then.
It's no problem. Anyway I have some stuff I need to --
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
That's okay.
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever I'm a little out of sorts today.
Yes?
Joel? It's Joel right?
Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
Okay.
I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.
Well anyway... Sorry.
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice so --
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
See I wouldn't think that about you.
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch truth be told.
Sorry. It's a pretty name though. It means "merciful" right?
Oh my darlin' oh my darlin' oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
I'm not nuts.
Huckleberry Hound! What are you nuts?
I don't know what that means.
Huckleberry Hound?
I don't know any jokes about your name.
No jokes about my name? Oh you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
I'm Joel.
My name's Clementine by the way.
Yeah I got it.
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
Well you don't know me so... you don't know do you?
Oh I doubt that's the case.
I think. Anyway I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
You sure? That doesn't sound --
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
I'm sure you would.
Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
Purple Haze Pink Eraser.
I don't really know how --
Anyway this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace Yellow Fever Green Revolution. That'd be a job coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
I can't remember.
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
I like it.
Ah the hair.  Blue right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name huh?
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
I don't have one.
Well I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
Jesus is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
Really? Because --
Ucch really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world huh? Yeah that's me: book slave there for like five years now.
The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders right?
Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
Rockville Center.
Just you know to chat a little maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train I mean of course.
It's okay really.
No I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
I mean it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --
Oh. So...
No I mean I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
Aw c'mon live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
Well I didn't want to assume.
Really?
No I didn't know if you were talking to me so...
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
Why what?
Why?
I'm sorry.
Jesus.
Your dried cum.
I don't know. Panties and --
Guess what I'm wearing.
You must have been crazy.
God I can't believe I ever hated you.
I'm just y'know passing the time best I can till I can see you.
Hey lover. Whatcha doing?
Hi it's Joel.
Joel we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
Look I have to go. I have to think.
I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
It's true.
That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
Maybe it's true then. It's my voice on the tape.
I mean I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
I probably got the same thing as you.
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
Yeah?
Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
I guess so.
Ha Ha! You said I do. I guess that means we're married.
Oddly enough I do.
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
I just walked in.
What took you so long?
There you are.  Naomi it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
That's me.
Long day thinking.
I just got in.
Yeah I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
I know. I had to take the day to think.
Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
How's it going?
Hi.
Hi Naomi it's Joel.
I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
Clementine.
Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
So you're still on the Zoloft?
But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought how cool an orange sweatshirt.
This is it. The night we met. My God it's over.
Okay. I wish you could come.
On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back erase it explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not maybe not. And then I thought as I always do at this point in my argument about dying.
Naomi.
I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
She's so sexy.
Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
How's the chicken?
And what are you like? A wino?
Right! She called me an old lady here too! And I remember I said...
Any messages Carmen?
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
So then she just stops calling.
Oh God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
That's your look for me.
Clementine.
Maybe if I just explain what happened I wouldn't have to go through this and I could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...
Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
I should maybe talk to you.
It's too late.
It's them.
The pill was pink I remember. It had some letters and numbers on it. What were they? AL 1718? AL something. Four digits. I don't like taking pills when I don't know what they are. I have no choice.
Pink.  There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718?  I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.
Fuck you Clementine.
Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all I'll get over it. Secondly it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
I might be making a mistake.
I'm like a joke to them.
The driver waved. So casual friendly.
There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.
It was snowing.
Yes but... I'm just something you're imagining. What can I do? I'm in your head too.
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
What? What do you mean?
You have to stop this!
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
Well... I did.
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
Well technically the procedure itself is brain damage but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
'Night.
We'll speak soon.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
I had a good time last night. I really did.
Okay Joel. I suppose you're right.
I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
So you think the dissertation will get published?
I'm glad you called.
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
Oh! Great. That's great!
Miss you too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
I miss you.
Oh sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
Well it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
Yeah.
I hope you get your work done.
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
So you don't mind?
In a minute.
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
Go back to sleep.
Hi Rob and Carrie.
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
How was it?
Hi.
Hi.
It's not somebody else.
The thing is Joel whatever it is you think you have with this chick once the thrill wears off you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
No. I just need some space maybe.
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
I think maybe we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy both have to be... by definition.
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
Y'know we've been I don't know sort of unhappy with each other and --
What?
I don't know I've just been thinking maybe we're not happy with each other.
So what's going on Joel?
Don't do this to me now Joel. Really.
Naomi I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
You take it. I don't know.
Yours?
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
Definitely!
I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful important things.
Very cool. Trippy.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
Yeah. Cool.
I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?
Nah I don't know.
Oh Patrick you didn't want any did you?
Hi Mary. How's it going?
Oh hey Patrick.
Mary... please. This is hurting people.
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
Mary people come to him voluntarily.
They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
Then why did you ask me?
I know what it is.
Nothing.
What's this?
Can I... I brought some --
What do you want Stan?
Hi.
Oh.
Thanks Stan.
You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
I really like you Mary. You know that.
I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
And after that?
Happy. Happy with a secret.
How did I look?
It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
Once maybe.
And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
I swear.
Do you swear you didn't know?
Hey.
Hell no.
You better go.
He's coming?
This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around Stan.
No way. I can handle this.
Shit!
Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
I don't know! I just said that!
Well what should we do?
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...
I don't know. He's not on the map.
Where?
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
Listen it's not erasing.
What?
It's stopped.
You love him don't you?
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh so clean so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
Yeah.
It's amazing isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world.
Go.
Let him go Stan. I can help.
Yup.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
Yup.
It's a good one all right.
Yeah I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
That's a good one.
Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.
Well allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
We haven't checked.
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
You found us okay?
It's freezing out.
I better do this Stan.
Hey if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak would you --
'kay.
See you later alligator.
Anyway I've got to do my tap dance here.
I know. Anyway --
It's just... y'know... I mean...
Sorry. I just --
Stan... c'mon...
Hi.
Boo.
I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But look I take full responsibility.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
It was a mutual decision.
You made me have an abortion.
I have a family Mary.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
I don't know what I'm supposed say Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?
We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
What Howard?
No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man Howard.
We can't do this.
I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids.
I've got a wife Mary. Kids. You know that.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
It's fine Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
That's lovely.
You are such a sweetheart.
It's no big deal.
Yes shit. Oops sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
Alexander Pope?
There's another one I like I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
It's a good quote Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
Yeah yeah it is Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
Is that Nietzsche?
Okay um there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful for they get the better even of their blunders."
Oh. Well I'd love to hear some.
Oh um like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like too.
How do you mean?
Do you like quotes Howard?
Well thank you Mary.
That was beautiful to watch Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
Okay we're back in.
Welcome Howard.
Thanks.
Cole slaw ice tea?
Order me a pastrami for after?
Yes?
Mary...
Thanks Mary. You can bring her in.
Howard your one o'clock.
1062 Sherman Drive. Apartment 1E Rockville Center.
Jesus. All right what's the address.
He went home sick.
Well where was Patrick?
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
Okay what happened right before he disappeared?
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
Stan? What's going on?
Jesus.
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
I don't know what you're talking about Howard.
She should not have done this Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --
Thanks Stan. Thanks.
So I've got to drop the van off.
That's fine Stan.
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
Oh dear.
Howard they've disappeared again.
Yeah probably a good idea.
You get some sleep Howard. I'll take it from here.
Yeah. Of course.
Did you try going through C-Gate?
I tried that already.
She came to help Howard.
Mary. What are you doing here?
December 15th 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
Ah your journal. This will be invaluable.
Maybe after the holidays then.
This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.
Of course. Please have a seat.
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
Hi I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
Oh hi.
Thanks Stan. I owe you.
I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
Patrick we're in the middle of --
Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --
It's a quote book.
What's your bartlett's?
Okay There's more Stan --
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
Jesus Patrick!
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties is what.
She was unconscious Patrick.
I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.
Patrick we need to focus.
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
This one's history. Moving on...
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
You can if you want.
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over too. I have a girlfriend now.
She likes you okay.
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
Just wanted to let you know.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Patrick let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
Not a dump then but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
It's an apartment.
Yeah that looks better. Thanks.
Does that help?
Then check the connections.
The voltage looks fine.
I like the sound of that.
We're going to have to work on your touch.
My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
Those yours too?
No I mean... I'm a little... dusty...
Relax it's casual.
I'm not really dressed for a party.
I'm blind not deaf. Wanna come in?
How'd you know it was me?
Trust me this ain't one of those times.
Such a sad face... You know sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
You wouldn't say that if you could see me.
I don't think She's real big on hate.
Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
I mean...
I wouldn't know anything about that.
You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring whispering --
This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
You know you could'a run an ad in the personals.
Victor must've taken him.
Where is Reed?
No it's not. I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now Ben.
It's easy for you to be patient.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
What did he do to the uniform?!
Oh he did.
He didn't.
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
You look like an eighties rock band.
Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
We need to give you a physical so we know what got zapped.
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
I can only stay for one drink Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
Is it safe?
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
Victor did.
I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?
I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
And you can? Power it up?
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
What do you want Vic?
Where do you think? With Sue.
What is this? Where's Reed?
Ben come in.
Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
About me? How sweet.
I'm worried about you.
What are you doing here?
I already got it. Everything I want.
What did you wish for honey?
Deb it's me. It's still me.
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
Baby you're scaring me.
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
Ben?
Out front? You home baby? I got a surprise for you.
Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
I don't care about rocks I care about you.  You bring him back in one piece or you can forget being Best Man.
Soon as I'm back I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
Just get back soon or I start looking for a new groom.
I'll be watching over you.
Forget it egghead. I'm good as is.
Ben I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings...
Got it teach.
Time for your lesson Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...
Ben I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
We're working as hard as we can --
Oh you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
Ben --
This isn't permanent Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.
It's about to be a broken face.
O-kay. We'll skip that question.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Ben I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Okay. I've uh got some questions from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you you know go to the bathroom... like normal...
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
You got a chisel round here?
Yeah nine years straight.
We had a tough year.
Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
Ben. Are you okay?
What the --!
I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
Are you alright?
Well maybe you should date him.
He's smart powerful successful --
I'm sorry did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
Reed I'm not talking about Debbie.
Yeah you and Debbie and perfect --
You go through something like this makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
I should have done more run more tests --
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Solid.
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
How long was I out?
Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
I ain't done arranging your flowers egghead.
Should?
The shields on the station should protect us.
Victor's better at these things.
This is your dream Reed. You should be the one up there.
He's made a few changes.
Isn't that your speech?
This makes five.
I had it at four.
Five times.
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
I'm sure he's matured since then.
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
Youthful high spirits.
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
External SRBs orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
I know I know. I'm just worried about what he wants... Speaking of which...
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
Ben think about all the people we can help if this works --
He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
Ben the money's not important. We could save lives.
What about his first born?
Ben. This is business. Just work.
I can't take this.
You'd never know it.
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
This wasn't our first stop in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little...  Larger than life.
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food strip-mall science --
Hey I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way wide load coming through.
No more cracks about how I look.
Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
Go back to the drawing board.
Hey! That's a prototype!
Give me the god damn mirror!
They said that's not such a good idea the shock alone could --
Give me a mirror...
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world Ben. You had the best --
What's wrong with me?
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
Reed?... Sue?
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Where... where am I?
Don't you wander off boy.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Let's see: you got Victor stud of the year more coin than God? Or Reed the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm it's a toss-up.
Hey two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Yeah well his eyes say different.
'Course not. Strictly business.
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Keep talking there won't be a next time.
If you behave maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Actually the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut and your mind on those SMBs --
That's terrible news...
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
What?
I wish I could tell you. I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here. I'll notify the CDC and --
What do you mean "complete"?
At this rate the infection should be complete in two maybe three weeks --
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
And they're changing into...
Your tissue your organs your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning somehow --
No: You're ON FIRE!
Not this again --
You're on fire!
Last one down springs for room service.
I though we went over this.
Stay right. Left is trouble.
Me like-y.
Meet me at 4:01 top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
My shift ends at four but I couldn't --
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
I mean you feel a little feverish.
So are you!
You're hot!
I don't know if "we've" noticed but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --
And where do we think we're going?
Now.
But all these people...
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
Act. Here we go again. Reed what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some you know... like calling?
You need to control yourself and think before you --
Right whatever have fun.
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
They're not costumes.
He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
Oh well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
Is there something about flames? About flaming that you --
Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
Not only could you kill yourself but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
I can go hotter!
Back it down Johnny!
...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
Oh it is.
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
You've been working out.
This is wrong in so many ways.
Ben are you there?
Oh you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
Cool. What'd it do to you guys?
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Now what is up with that?
Ben! Ben!
He's not responsive --
What about you?
Victor's right. Johnny get to the command center. Close the shields.
But Johnny... you can't fly.
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
What are you doing --
No I'm sorry for pushing you out.
I'm sorry sis for leaving you guys --
As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them.
Look around sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
Johnny slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
Is that what you call it? "Real"?
Yeah for the last time I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
Johnny? Did you see Ben?
Blockhead started it!
You two need a time-out.
You gave us names? What are you the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
You're gonna pay for that Pebbles.  What?!
Dude. That's my sister.
I'm driving.
Girl...?!
Uh we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl.
That's the temperature of the sun.
Sweet.
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter you're approaching supernova --
You're really cramping my style here.
Is that a trick question? C'mon I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
Grow up Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
I think that thing is Ben.
What is that thing?
Okay "mom."
Stop it.
Johnny.
Flame on flame off. Flame on flame off --
Please tell me you go silent too.
Apparently I can disappear.
Keep the hot side hot and the cool side cool!
The synthetics act as a second skin adapting to your individual needs to --
Top left like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow who knows... maybe Washington.
Front page?
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Make sure you find Ben bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know when they asked Caesar "why England he said, because it's not mine."
Sir I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --
Later. First I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...
You know maybe you should get some rest --
And that's a good thing?
Actually uh people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Get me on the AM shows Larry King cover of the Journal...  I've got to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Sir I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
Reed's disaster. You know I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number considering the fallout from --
How's the IPO?
Recording sir. We see you perfectly.
Leonard how's the feed?
History Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Then what is it?
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
Showtime.
They're ready for you sir.
Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
And if he's not...?
If Reed's right then this little trip will double our stock offering.
A gasket? Reed we're at a party.
I found a broken gasket from space --
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Sue I need some of that anger rage frustration --
You need a doctor.
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
Reed stop you need to rest your --
I can... make it work.
That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
Why didn't you say something?
When I walked out I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
I did. I did Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
I gave him twenty.
You know I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
Of course I was. I'd read all your papers on bioethics. Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
You were?
Remember our first date here...? God I was so nervous.
Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
I'm not the only one in there. I got you Vic Ben Johnny all rattling around in there.
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat sleep. You can't live in your head like --
Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day checking every variable --
Better than your life. Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing. We are.
He was going to take away all my data equipment --
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
No way to know. Without more tests experiments.
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
With the right energy we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
Of course. Of course.
But we're the focus right Reed? Reed...?
Curing countless diseases not just ours.
And reverse the mutations --
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm we can reverse the polarity --
The plants from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
What are you doing?
No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
There were a lot of variables to consider --
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
I think it was a little more complicated than --
Reed. I was ready for the next step you weren't ergo I walked.
No I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo...
Are you kidding?
I mean you broke up with me right?
What in the world would give me that idea?
I'm sorry I'm sorry I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
I'm saying if you had a little more self control you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when --
Excuse me?
You should be able to bend light around other objects even people if you could control your emotional state better --
What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
If it happened to him then it could...
That's what we're here to find out.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
What...?  Oh.
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
We need to get past them.
What?
Let's not jump to conclusions we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
Sue... look at your hands.
What? What do you mean you --
Uh Sue...? I can't.
You are such a dork Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
For science.
Passion.
Which was?
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
You're happy for me and Victor.
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
That's good. That's uh... good.
Yes thanks.
Feeling better?
Great minds think alike.
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.
Well he's welcome to ride shotgun but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
As far as crew I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
It's been changed.
I uh think I remember the number.
Right. That's exactly what I meant.
Well uh based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or uhm maybe I should take the biotech you work the microscopes since you have some background in electropho--
I was talking about us. Working together.
Those solar winds are flaring but I factored them into my coordinates and --
Never better.
You're you've I mean how have you bee--
Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.
But I'm not done with the machine --
What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents Reed. This all belongs to me.
What are you doing here?
I don't want to understand it. This isn't one of your science projects. I just want to fix it. Fast!
Victor if we could understand what happened to us --
Abort? Reed I put my company my name billions of dollars on the line and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
I ruined? With all due respect I told you to abort --
Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --
Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
Ben did this?
Ben did this.
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
It's too late for him and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
Not until Ben is back inside!
Reed we're running out of time.
Come on Ben come on...
So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.
Ben's still out there --
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
We've got minutes until it hits not hours... Victor that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.
Sure.
Got it. So take a walk Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Hilarious.
Funny how things turn out isn't it?
The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
You back this mission and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
Not at all.
This isn't going to be a problem is it?
You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
But dreams don't pay the bills do they?  Same old Reed the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars with the world on your back.
Victor we can't do anything until the research is ready.
Oh I think you already have.
Please don't make this personal --
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
If these molecules aren't stable they could make us worse maybe even kill us.
Same old Reed. All analysis no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested analyzed before --
Susan. What are you doing?
Victor wait slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me but I just don't --
It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...
You said it was urgent.
Please no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
I told you I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
Victor your scar --
Just find him.
Victor I'm sorry I --
Victor are you feeling alright?
What's going on?
You can't leave them out there.
Raising the shields.
What are you doing?
Sue I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Uh Victor I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Right of course the company... But you see I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
It's been a good two years Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
Well when you're looking at your future it never hurts to find closure about the past.
I understand the business reasons.
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research Susan Storm.
It's just business.
Skeptical...?
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Reed's gonna fix me up --
I'm just saying I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away and know it's never coming back.
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
'Scuse me.
I'll go.  We'll both go.  Far away.
You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another.
I want to talk.  I just learned again.
Shhh... don't talk.
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
Emma...
Yes.
Do you still want me to stay?
Yes.
You want me to stay?
Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
That's who you are too Emma.
I don't know.
Who?
Humans.
What's inside?
Yes.
Have you looked inside?
I don't know.
Have you always had it?
Mine.
I know it.  What do you want Robert?
We don't know that --
Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.
You know what I mean.
What do you mean?
What do you want?
If I'm a hunter it's because you taught me to be!
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
I only protect myself -- !
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
What choice did I have -- ?!
You're not them.
Why don't you start with me?
You want to kill them.
Yes.
You want to find them.
Where you lived with them.
What?
Do you remember where it is?
Yes.
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
My wife.
Who is this?
Dark and large.  With vines -- no not vines.  Not alive.
When you're here in the city where do you live?
We move.  Place to place.
Yes.
With them?
What about... now?
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
Do you remember where you lived?
It comes back.  Flashes.  My name.
How much do you remember?
Do you want to go on?
Yes.
Are you all right?
Listen to me my blood somehow... helped you.  It could help all of you.  We could find some way to --
It is not arguing to speak the truth.
My name is Robert.
That is not now human!
You lived like this once.
I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
No.
You -- think I am -- I'm --  -- an animal.
Stay alive.
That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
Tell me about the interesting people you met won't you?
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
Good evening.  Did you have a pleasant day today?
What?
Virginia...?
The more we plant the more that'll grow and the happier --
Well it's not supposed to be done anyway.
It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
Besides if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
I surrender --
Yeah but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
You and that damned garden.
It was at Diane's party in Malibu and I had just broken up with Todd and I was loaded for bear any man who had the nerve to come at me -- watch out.  So you come sauntering in -- you know that saunter you do. That watch out baby here comes Mr. Smooth thing.
Yes.
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
Round back.
Bathroom?
I guess you could say that.
You built things.
I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
So what do you do?
You got that right.
Hell of a night.
That's fine.
Only got one kind.
Please.
Need some gas?
RUN!
What --
I'm sorry John but you have to run again.
Oh Jesus...
She's not alive but she didn't die.
She's still alive?
She grew up.
She died?
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
Who wanted her little girl back?
Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
I am going back.  I see myself there.
Agatha you're never going back there.
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank I won't remember any of this.
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
The other two will die without me.
Why?
I have to go back.
Someplace safe.
Where are we going?
But you still have a choice.  The others never had a chance to see their future.  You did.
I can't leave.  You said so yourself there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
Please I want to go back...
You were right.  I'm not being set up.
Anderton --
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
What is it?
Oh God...
I have to find out what happened to my life.  Agatha.  I'm not going to kill the man.  I don't even know him.
Please --
I can't.  I have to know.
Anderton leave.
He's here.
Wait.
Agatha...
He won't.
He'll turn around.
No.  Follow him.
Do it.  Right here.  On the ground.
Forget that guy --
Drop some money.
What?
Can you see the balloon man?
Agatha --
Agatha...
Take it.
Who?
They're inside.
What?
Is it now?
What?
Is it now?
I'm sorry but I need your help. You contain information.  I need to know how to get it.  Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?  Can you tell me if --
Can you see?
Wally!
How did I not see this?  Agatha who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?
John?  What is it?
I know... I do too...
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
Anne Lively...
About who?
Because I found out about her...
Think John.  Why would they set you up?
Somewhere.
Found?  Where?
Just some guy... they found.
Then who was he?
-- but he didn't.
-- go blind.  I know.
I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then or you'll --
Organic microbots that reconstruct the nerves and blood vessels. It'll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs.  But whatever you do don't scratch.
The nano... what?
I know you're in a hurry so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
I can't even stand up --
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
Here --
How do I find the --
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
So uh if you were a plastic surgeon before...
And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others but let's change the subject shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?
You set your patients on fire!
They were performance pieces.
You made those tapes...
Yes you did.
I put you away --
Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
From where?  D.C.?
Oh yes.
We know each other?
You don't remember me do you?
Tell you what since you and I go way back I'll give you my Old Pal discount.  How's that sound?
It's all I could safely move.
That's not much.
Whatever you say John.
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
Why?
I know that but I wanna keep the old ones.
And replace them with new ones.
Yeah --
Anesthesia.  Try to relax John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
Right.  I know --
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
That's comforting.
Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
It's actually kind of a rush.  They say you get visions; that your life flashes before your eyes.  That all your dreams come true.
Lara --
You're part of my flock now John. Welcome.
So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?
Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
Hey you wanna know where the word came from "glitch?"
No... we have the two previsions from the twins right here but...  ... I can't pull up any data from the female.  Probably just a glitch.
Try again.
Huh we don't seem to have her data.
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
Not to mention "Saved by the bell".
... Graveyard shift.
Hence the expression...
I work graveyard swing and day all by my lonesome.
You the only sentry?
For that we have to go for a ride.
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
That's an old one.  One of our first.
This about the Justice Department?  They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  Told me to wear a tie.  You like this one?
Victim's a white female.
Drowning.
Kill type?
No you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
I don't ever see any of you precops down here I'm not in trouble am I?
Yes sir.  I'm Gideon.  The music relaxes the prisoners.
You the sentry?
Then go ahead pull the trigger.
No doubt.
No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.
Beauty?  The precogs don't even always agree with each other!
People want to believe in the system.  That's the beauty of it...
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
John --
Everybody runs.
You can't run --
I'm not getting halo'd.
John.  Please.  Listen to me --
John.  Just tell me who's Leo Crow?
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar I need you to talk to Wally see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
We're years from that.  John I'm asking you: please come in we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
Can you fake the cerebral output?
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
All right John just take a breath let's think about this...
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
And who the hell is that?
Somebody named Leo Crow.
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
Justice already knows.  Talk to me John.  Tell me what's happening?
Just so you know I've overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --
No?  How's an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?
We won't let them.
You understand John that the minute Precrime goes national they're going to take it away from us.
I'm fine Lamar.
What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
In the middle of the night?
I go running down there.
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
I'm fine.
She's worried about you.  And quite frankly so am I.
What?
Lara called me.
He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us John.
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there.  And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
And you say the third prevision was what a little fuzzy or something?
Tuck in your shirt.
I understand.  What's the other thing?
You can let him look around answer his questions but watch him.  If there's any problems make sure we know about it first.
Yes sir.
I need you to do two things for me. One watch Danny Witwer.
I understand.  Sir.
You understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
Don't apologize John.
Lamar I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
Hang on Lamar --
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
Uh-huh...
Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
The nation votes this week...
Don't worry Lamar.
Tell me not to worry John.
You don't have to chase me Fletcher.
You don't have to do this Chief.
Everybody runs.
Don't run Chief.  You know we'll catch you.  You trained us.
I show a cop on horseback.
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
The brick has been repointed the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
What he's doing now we call "scrubbing the image" looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
Uh sir...
All I need some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went check all relations --
I wrote it down in your calendar then left a message at your house --
You're kidding that's today?
Chief the investigator from the Fed is here.
Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
Seventeen minutes.
Take your time.
Sure Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
Uh yeah you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
Still scrubbing... looks like there's a third party somebody wearing shades just out the window...
Any ID on the shooter yet?
Confirm with trig and image.
That was easy.
I show time of occurrence Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
Check NCIC maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And Jad I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
Amazing there's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that.
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
Red Ball?
We're in motion on something.
Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
Go back to work.  All of you.
Sir?
Uh-huh.  Jad?
Come on Chief you think about it the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
You guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he's talking about.
Did Marks close the front door?!
What?
Did he close the front door?
Go ahead.
Now look at him...
Yeah?  So?
Look at the kid.  In this one he's on the left of the man in the suit.
Georgetown.
The mall?
No maglev system.
Somewhere near the capital?
From solar position Trig & Image confirms it at approximately eight oh-four a.m.
Send a DCPD blue & white out there set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
Run the subscription list...
We can't grab it...
Case #1108 previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
Red Ball -- double homicide: one male one female.  Killer's male white 40's.
Okay Jad what's coming?
Possession alone will cost you six months not to mention your badge.
You gonna tell on me?
It seems I've found a flaw John  You.
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
You set me up...
I agree.  The system is perfect. If there's a flaw it's human.  It always is.  Thank you for the tour Wally.
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
Flaws.
Why don't you cut the cute act Danny and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
I don't know.  He was shot and killed when I was fourteen on the steps of his church in Bethesda.
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.
The oracle isn't where the power is anyway.  The power's always been with the priests.  Even if they had to invent the oracle.
Just a nickname.
But you call this room the "temple".
The precogs are pattern recognition filters nothing more.
I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
If it's a question of authority.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
Really?  You've never been inside?
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
To them.
To Hineman?
Speaking of interfacing I'd love to say hello.
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs designed the system and pioneered the interface.
Then why can't they see rapes or assaults... or suicides?
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do only what you will do.
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
But it didn't fall.  You caught it.
Yes.
You're certain?
Because it was going to fall.
Why did you catch that?
Yes it is.
But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
You mind if I tag along?
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
As I recall they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
I'm sorry Danny but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
Just go to the beginning!
There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
Are these all of her previsions?
Oh... Hi John.
I like you Wally so I'm not gonna kick you or hit you with anything but only if you promise to help me...
Do I know you?  Who are you?
Wally listen to me...
She said...
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
She spoke to me.
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
She was looking right at me.
She grabbed you?  Impossible.  The Precogs aren't even aware of us. In the milk all they see is the future.
Nothing... she grabbed me and then there was an image on the screen...
Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
It helps if you don't think of them as human.
They're not in any pain.  We keep their heads pretty well stocked with dopamine and endorphins. Plus we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels -- don't want 'em to drift off to sleep but they can't be kept too awake either.
Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
I can't touch you!  And John you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
Uh I'll try...
Rufus play it back...
I guess that's all of it.
What happened?  Where's the rest?
Tell me how.
Stop --
Then take her to Radio Shack.
They don't belong to anybody.
I tell you what.  I do this I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
So now I need you to hack into her.
So?
C'mon Rufus you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
She's got information inside of her.  I need you to get it out.
I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do!  And I swear I didn't do any of the stuff I did!
Rufus for Christ's sake get up.
Are you reading my mind right now?
That's right.
She's a precog?
Rufus.  She's a precog.
I'm impressed Anderton.  You're on the lam but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
Well hello there honey-pie.
I need help with her.
Well hey you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you Chief I make housecalls...
I need your help.
Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus what's up with your eye?
Hold your breath Dad...
Sean wait...
I'm your son.  I'm you.
Who are you?
Good-bye Dad...
I wanted to.
I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
I was looking for you...
The more you want to believe something the easier it is to be fooled.
I forgive you...
Once I even told him I loved him.
I forgive you.
I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
Sean --
The funny thing is I started to believe he really was my Dad.
Oh Sean --
No.  He got tired of pretending.
You're alive?
I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
What the hell.
Wanna hear something funny?
It's a little late for that.
You gotta have faith Dad.
Sean -- you're not real.
All right I'll try...
Come on!
Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way on my best day I could ever beat twelve seconds!
Okay... now let me time you.
I love you too!  I love you daddy.  Love ya dad.
Four.  Wow.  What a big boy.  I love you Sean.
What a big boy.  How old are you?
I won!
That's great.
I scored a goal!
Good-bye Crow.
You're not gonna kill me...
Let go of the gun.
Tell me!
Kill me!
Who made you do this?
If I tell you my family gets nothing.
Tell me who was it set this up?
Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me Goddammit before I lose my nerve!
What about the picture --
What the fuck is going on?
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is the next day I was out so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look man you gotta go through with this.
I'm asking you again who made you do this?
Look believe me I know it's hard but you gotta do it --
Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
Look I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
Who said I would?
You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
If you don't kill me my family gets nothing!
The precogs were wrong.
But you have to.  They said you would.
No.
You're not gonna kill me?
NO!
It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --
I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.
Where've you got him?  Is he all right?  Tell me you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!
He's alive?
... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song made him laugh bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
His name was Sean.  Six years ago. Francis pool.
Some -- somebody's father?
Do you know who I am?
Did I?  I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --
Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
The female.
Which one is that?
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
How do I even know which one has it?
Sometimes in order to see the light you have to risk the dark.
I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
You're insane or you think I am.
Actually I think you'll have to run out but yes that's what you have to do.
-- and then walk out.
If... you have one.
That's all huh?  Just walk right into Precrime go into the Temple somehow tap into the Precogs and then download this Minority Report...
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
Where?
The safest place of all.
What safe place is that?
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
You said they're destroyed.
You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
Why should I trust you?
Hold that thought.
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
You want to bring it down.
Do you?  Really?
I believe in that system...
The system would collapse.
Insignificant to you maybe but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
Yes of course he knew but at the time he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well in my experience parents often see their children as they want them to be not as they are.
Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might just might have an alternate future.
You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people?
Obviously for Precrime to function there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable but it's still doubt.
Why?
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
Most of the time all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while one of them will see things differently than the other two.
What?
I can't help you.  No one can.  The Precogs are never wrong.
So you won't help me?
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
Not if I stay away from him.
And yet a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now isn't it?
You say some of the children died?
Back then he was still a DA and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way you know paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
And how did Lamar become involved?
It began as play.  A guessing game like you play with any toddler except these children always guessed right.  And then the nightmares started. They were all different but all the same.  They were all about murder.  And the murders were all happening.
You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.
You're talking about the precogs...
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
Heal who?
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them not turn them into... something else.
You don't seem all that proud.
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention then yes I invented precrime.
What's so funny?
And how would I know that?
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
I'm... not... a... killer.
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
The vine -- the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall...
The what?
Yes I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
I'm a little dizzy...
Something wrong?
Lara I don't know why this is happening.  I just know they're setting me up.  I can't trust anybody.  I don't know who to talk to or where to go...  Lara?  Are you there?
Then how did he --
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
Oh God what did you do?
He's dead Lara.
John?
Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
Lamar --
But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
No.  I don't think you do.  The other day when he came to the cottage he talked about a lot of things but Danny Witwer the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
I understand.
No.  That's what everyone thinks.  John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
Sean --
Lamar do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
He also said Crow was a fake.
We know why John was tagged.
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
I don't know who that is.
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
Who?
I was but this whole incident with John made me realize the fragility of what we've built here.  This is John's legacy as much as mine and I want to protect that.
I thought you were retiring?
It's insanity around here.
You look great.
I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
No it isn't Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
This is all my fault.
Thank you.  This is Burgess.
You have an emergency call on your private line.
I padded your expense account for the last six months.
How did you get this?
My God...
Congratulations sir.
I'll be right there.
Sir the press conference is starting.
Not.  Now.
He just wanted a few minutes before --
Tell him not now.
The guy from USA Today is here.
Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things Danny?  Because right now the Precogs can't see.
What?
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
Of course it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place someone fairly high up --
Yes.
So there is a way to fool the system?
We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
Precog Deja Vu...
Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
By fooling the system.  All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place then a few minutes later commit the crime in exactly the same way.
How?
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
Danny tell me what you're thinking.
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is why would someone want this erased from the data file?
I know.  He came to me told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
According to the Sentry Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
This murder is happening at two different times.
I don't understand --
Now the second image.  Watch the water.  The wind's changed.  The ripples are going the other way.
Not quite.
It's the same prevision.
Yes.  This is from the twins Arthur and Dashiel.  Agatha's stream was missing.  Now this one is from the cyberparlor.  Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch...
He told me about this.  You got this from Containment?
Wait just a second...
Good God.  What was that?
Where are you?
I don't wanna say over the phone but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
What?
Lamar I found something.
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
He's my subordinate!
Oh it's all my damn business now Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
None of your damn business.
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
The man lost a child for Christ's sake...
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping yet you did nothing about it.
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year and I'm inclined to agree.
He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
Get the hell outta here.  You sick bastard.
No I wanna kill my boss!
Uh yeah being concert master of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
Good.  What I can do is set you up down in the --
Right here.
Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
I wanna kill my boss.
Near Death's real popular right now which includes everything from getting hit by a car to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush you come out the other side without a heart attack.
None.  This was arranged.
How many?
I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy Gordon?
Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
What kind of cop were you before this?
They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
If you were a child killer you took these pictures would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
I don't know why?
There a maid in this hotel?
No.  He can't...
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
He's trying to prove his innocence.
She's in the room with him when he kills Crow.  She's already a part of his future.
We can stop him.
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
Two?
There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
Because he thinks he's innocent.
No offense sir but why wouldn't he just run?
Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket.  There's fewer consumers down there which means fewer scanners to target him.
They're everywhere.
There's thousands of units like this one.
Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
Yes I know.
Sir the team's gonna be light without those men.
What?!
Actually Gordon you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
Somehow I don't think that was Walt Whitman.
Because of the nature of murder.  "There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".
I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
People have gotten the message.  Gum?
Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
That's the Red Ball Alarm.
Can't they shut that off?
Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes we go national there's gonna be nowhere to run.
So if you wanna kill someone you take him to Miami.
Nice to meet you.  Gum?
This is Evanna the team pilot.
You "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years not one damn murder...
John Anderton was my friend!
Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
Why don't I feel like celebrating?
Knott!
People if you don't let the spyder scan you we'll have to come in and arrest you.
It's not at all that you don't trust me to be alone with the Chief.  That you think I might you know fuck with him if I had the chance...
I think you're swell company Knott.
That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie isn't it?
I forgot my glasses.
Howard --
Sure.  Raincheck.
Raincheck?
Ah.  That must be why you look so nice.
I'd love to but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
We could have lunch together.
I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
What about your meeting?
How can you even tell?  You know how blind you are without your glasses.
The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
Who?
He looks familiar.
But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
I haven't seen him in two years.
To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later he's going to contact you.
To what?  Trap him?
You know I need to use you.
I left him because every time I looked at him I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
Not very well I'm sure.  I'd probably start doping myself.  Or maybe I'd...
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son let's see how well you handle it.
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement Lara...
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway John was upset. He... he...
What was it then?
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
Yes.
But John was with him at the pool?
It was nobody's fault.
You mean after he lost your son.
Since right after we lost our son.
Have you been there recently?
That was our apartment.
So you haven't seen his apartment?
No but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
No.
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
I don't have any sugar either.
He's not here now is he?
We used to every summer.
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
Cream and sugar.
Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
I like it.
Yes.
This your work?
I know who you are.
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
Jesus...
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female she's the key.  She's the one they listen to the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
Wally the other two can still function right?
But there's still the other two.
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
What does he want with a precog?
They've never been separated before.
Tell me how all this works.
Shhh!  They're sleeping.
Nice to meet you Wally.
Don't touch him.
Daddy.
No dad!
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
Morgan took a sip. It has his amoebas in it.
This one?
A hair.
This one?
There's dust in it.
She doesn't answer me either.
No.
Does she ever answer back?
It makes me feel better.
Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?
What are you thinking about?
Right.
Only for pee or poop.
What's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?
It tastes old.
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
I saw a monster. Can I have a glass of water?
What's the matter?
Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed. Make sure the knot's tight.
Houdini's sick.
Me too.
I'm scared.
Who said I was going to die?
I don't want you to die.
That's weird.
The same windows.
Dad!
My ballet recital.
Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  For your children Bo.
I heard them Morgan.
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
He licks his butt everyday. He's not going to mind.
It tastes funny.
It's not contaminated. It's just tap water. Pour it in his bowl.
You don't even know what that word means.
I think it's contaminated.
What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
And tell Merrill to swing away.
Tell him... See. Tell him to see.
I'm here.
...Tell Graham --
...I will.
...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
...I will.
...Tell Morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly.
Good.
I don't feel much.
Does it hurt?
You love walks.
I was just taking a walk before dinner.
Hi baby.
Hi sweetie.
Boy why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A?
Five. The five longest.
You got two minor league home run records don't you?
I got the bat at home... On the wall.
Clear for what?
It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group very small to check out things. Not to engage but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...
I see.
I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
You do?
Don't.
Graham.
Graham.
Don't touch him.
Me too.
That's good enough for me.
I know.  We need to be sure before we open that door Graham.
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared but who knows for sure?
Have they said anything about our area?
He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
Listen there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take is when my older brother --  -- who is everything I want to be starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night.  I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again okay? I'm serious.
No.
A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now.  They're leaving. Beat.
How do they know it's over?
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
How many died?
It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up.  We won Graham.
They're broadcasting...
I'm close.
It's getting stronger.
Me too.
I can feel air.
From what?
They're distracting us?
Got it!
Merrill!
I'm looking!
Merrill --
I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
We won't be able to get out of there.
He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar. Your grandma said "No." He tried to take a bite so I grabbed it.
What are you doing?
He was only a year and half old.
They're right behind the door.
Should we make a run for it out the back?
Did I ever tell you I dislocated Uncle Merrill's arm?
We have to go in the basement.
This is going to do nothing.
While they were trying to fix her up all she kept asking about was you.
They're on the roof.
They already know we're here.
Should we turn off the lights?
Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
Chicken Teriyaki.
Did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
I'm sorry what book is this?
Ray Reddy's house.
Where are you going?
Already thought of. Two other birds did the same thing an hour later. Not as dramatic. They lived. But you could see they hit something.
The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going like an optical illusion.
Eleven a.m. They're gone.
What time is it?
That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
What's furry furry rabbit?
For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
What does it matter then?
Yes.
Do you feel comforted?
Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? Give me some comfort?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
How can you say that?
Yes.
Do you think it's a possibility?
I got him.
Morgan be careful.
That's right.
It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?
It's noise.
I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
Pharmacy crowded?
He's telling you the truth Edgar. Whoever it was is very strong and can jump pretty high.
That roof is over ten feet high.
Bo can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?
This guy got on the roof in like a second.
Yes it was.
It was very dark.
Yes it was.
It was very dark.
I heard.
I cursed.
You want him coming in the house next time?
No I'm not.
Are you going to do this or what?
Explain noises.
Just make noises then.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
You don't mean it. It's just for show.
I'm not going to curse.
Curse and stuff.
Explain act crazy?
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
Okay this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!
Yeah baby. I think someone did.
Did someone save me?
I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
I can't even imagine.
You're scaring your sister.
They'll read our minds!
Don't yell at her!
Stop crying!
Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
We'll keep her in the garage after dinner.
What about Isabelle?
The family room.
Where are we going to sleep?
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
Sounds made up.
What do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water and we might be safe from them near a lake or something?
They win.
What's two?
They said one of two things could happen. One they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
I just asked his name.
Dad.
Bimboo?
Dr. Bimboo one of the authors of the book --
That means they're unemployed.
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
Who wrote this book?
It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because as their brains developed there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
They tell you everything in this book.
Oh.
So the aliens can't read our minds.
It gets clearer the higher you hold it.
Morgan?
Don't do it.
I'm getting out now.
We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.
We might lose the signal.
It's old Morgan.
It's still making the noises. It's broken.
I have some upstairs.
These are D's; I need double A's.
Edgar come inside.
It needs batteries.
Yes.
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
What did you say?
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
Pinned? What does that mean?
See Father Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
Why not?
She's not in an ambulance Father.
Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.
Is he okay?
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
You take care of yourself...  Graham.
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind on everyday things. It's good medicine.
And three weeks.
Six months.
But I'll tell you something what I said in their still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
No.
Is anything missing?
No.
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
I don't think so.
Edgar it sounds as strange to me saying it as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously just in case it is something serious.
Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.
I would say so.
Okay.  So he was tall?
He definitely wasn't a midget.
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
It does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
You can't describe him at all? Don't you think that's find of odd?
No Father they're edgy. On alert. Like they act when they smell a predator around... Peeing on themselves and everything.
Sounds like a virus.
Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
What was the first thing?
Second thing this week I can't explain.
What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
It's not broken.
There are none.
What about them?
The footprints.
You said something was strange. What's strange?
Sorry.
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
What's that?
Don't call me Father.
It's the strangest thing Father.
They'll find a way in.
What book!
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
Don't worry.
Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  Nothing really bad is going to happen is it Uncle Merrill?
They think it might happen all at once.
It's like War of the Worlds.
They think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
You'll lose the signal!
Don't do it!
Yeah.
Is that him?
I'll tell you what no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
And that makes you look like a squid?
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
What?
Sherry you gonna create a hysteria?
That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
Dude's a half--squid. Ain't many places he can hide. Sea World maybe.
How are you going to find him?
Don't fuck with me Bill. Your post here as Chief is in dire straits you don't work this shit out.
Hell Jack your leisure activities ain't my business.
Bill this Brenda's Randy Flagg's niece. We need to find Grant yesterday! The town council has lit a Roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
'Mornin' Jack.
Bill we need to talk!
Shit.
You're right Jack. Margaret you're fired.
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility like keeping your people in line.
Bill you're Chief of police now. 
And this is mine.
It's my nature.
You took Bill.
Please Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
Okay.
We'll just head up here into Bishopville get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all huh?
Aspirin.
I'll get it for you. Ibuprofen or aspirin?
Yeah. Good.
We can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
No Starla! No!
He wants me Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me and kill him!
What?
We can't make it. Just get away when you get the chance.
What are you doing?!
Hell Starla. I always regretted that.
After all this shit tonight I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
I'm sorry.
That wasn't a good night no.
When you wanted to run away I called your dad.
My father he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve things... well they got worse. Starla looks at Bill who seems struck.
Well big ol' Lincoln sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
I know what people say Bill. I... Remember back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
Bill I'll run out to your car call for paramedics from there.
No reception out here.
It is. He'd been acting strange. And the physical changes. I should have told someone right away... But I was just blind. I wanted to pretend it wasn't happening... If I don't do what I can to help now I just couldn't live with it.
Starla it ain't --
Please Bill. What happened it's my fault I know it.
He did. I know. But I got him angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This time I could --
He tried to kill you Starla.
Wait! Dammit Bill if that girl's still out there how will you find her? How unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
Why? Listen it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
Bill I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
New? No. We're hoping we find Grant he'll lead us to her.
How about Brenda?
She disappeared Friday night. We got reason to believe foul play might be involved.
No. What?
Maybe she's ever called the house or -- ?
Hey Grant.
Grant where'd you go?
I'll get Wally to show me sometime then.
Mm hm. But only a few folks know how to get there. Wally. Rollo Linkski coulda taken you but 'course he got hit by that train. Me.
Oh yeah?
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right like tonight the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot.
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
Pretty ain't they?
Just checking out the lights.
What you up to?
Tryin' to get a buzz on. But I'm too buff. Too much muscle mass.
Whatcha' doin'?
Sorry.
That's not funny.
Don't worry. The lurker ain't around. I checked.
Just block the doors any way you can.
What the hell are we going to do?!
Shelby!
When I buy my zoo I'm leaving them things the hell out!
A Martian is from Mars Trevor.
He's a fucking Martian?!
We're coming your way man!
Where are you?!
I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying Bill?
And then we get here the Castavets' where last night's shit--storm took place.
Think we should get up a search party head in there?
He's gotta be in the forest. All three ranches run alongside it.
That's the mystery of the ages there Trev. Starla was seventeen when they got engaged. He was like in his thirties. No one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
What's she see in that douchebag?
What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital Bill?
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither Wally.
Looks like a chipmunk.
What do you see? I see a butterfly.
Rorschach.
The problem Starla is the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
Oh yeah. Fuck you fat ass.
What?
Hey Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
Don't worry Chief.
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
Hey there Chief.
Do it.
I got to leave my post.
Shelby we broke down on 22 a mile outside town. Come pick us up.
We'll be there in ten minutes.
Sorry.
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Yeah.
Are you nodding?
Shelby shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
Oh shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so I apolog
Shelby --
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
Listen you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs only fast.
You dig that rat out of the hole?
Brought you munchies.
Grant? Grant I'm hungry. I'm so fuckin' hungry I think I'm gonna die.
Stuff you can never imagine. Feelings. Big thoughts. And love. Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it into somethin' more. So go ahead there beautiful and take off your shirt.
What?
Guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
Took the kids to his Mom's for the weekend.
Where's the old half--Mexican?
Shut up.
You're lookin' awful pretty.
Starla Covington. Don't be ignorant. Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
Fuck lucky. Never marry a damn half--Mexican.
Who's the lucky fella?
Hell I was game!
Shit girl you couldn't'a been eleven.
My sister Megan she's a big fat cow. Was then even more so now. I'd be thinking what'd you see in her ain't in me?
Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell you were --
Megan Halesy' little sister.
Yep. And while you're at it get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and ooo what's this here? Osso buco?...
All the rib eyes?
Hell what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
How many you need?
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
What can I do you for?
Sure thing killer.
Howdy Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
Meat.
Grant you're sick!
I loved you. I loved --
Grant no!
Why'd you betray me sugarplum?!
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
I'll get if for you.
Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine in a couple days.
Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
It's just one of my students Grant.
Who's that?
You're pretty.
What are you doing?
I got a super--special birthday present for you this year. I couldn't risk you finding it so I had to put them locks on the doors.
Okay.
You're my princess aren't you?
My present?
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
Welcome home.
Wearing white just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
I never danced in a towel before.
Out.
That's not true -- Where are you--?
I'm just some big clown to you ain't I?
Where are you going?
That's disrespectful.
Flip.
Sure you do.
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
Grant no -- I'm sorry I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on baby it's --
Work thing hell Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at them sick fucks.
It's just a work thing.
Oh yeah that's what he wants to borrow this guy.
He's teaching environmental science Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads grows. A living disease.
When one sees you they all see you.
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked like one creature?
He took him over. His body. His -- his brain everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
Through a wound on his stomach?
Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.
What other stuff?
But not always. I was -- He was... other stuff too.
Margaret.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it Margaret.
Praise Jesus.
We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
Where'd he go?
Hey look!
So he drags the cow backwards here. Only he prolly didn't know 'bout the Castavets had them dogs.
Gold--digger huh?
Ain't no mystery to it. She's raised in them shanties off St. Luc. Dirt--poor.
And you're not?  Maybe you're my puppet.  But like all puppets you think you're actually human.  It's The Puppet's Dream.  Wondering if they're human!
A puppet.
No?  Who am I then?
You're not Gibarian...
You'll end up like me.
I can trust Rheya.
What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort.
It can.  Ordinary matter like ours? Not affected.  Everything else disintegrates.
Can it work?
You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day until they're back on Earth.
What do you want?
You think you're dreaming me like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian.  Just a new incarnation.
Leave the light off.
Gibarian.
Yes.
Where's Snow?  Did you call him?
If it continues it will implode from its own weight and turn into a black hole in about four hours and pulls us in with it.
How quickly?
It's changing characteristics.  It's solidifying taking on weight.
Whose side are you on?
You fucking bastard...
It's not human Kelvin.  Whatever it is it's not human and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
Why would you let her to do that?
No she won't.
She'll come back.
Kelvin she begged me.  I had a short- range version of the destabilizer prototype a miniature with a range of a few meters.  She walked into it and disappeared.  She was gone.
You murdered her!
Not her.  It.
You killed her!
Why did you agree to come here?
That's fantastic.
Yes.
Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
She reappeared exactly as she had before?
No.  There's no behavior modification.
We're done.  Oh I should tell you I don't trust Snow.  There's something wrong with him.
Listen --
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is make it stop and then I will go home.
They shouldn't let people like you into space.
Her?  Who are you talking about?
In the lab.  With her probably.
Where's his body?
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
I am here to recover this mission report my findings and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
Who here could possibly care what you want?  At best you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
I want to hear your version.
Didn't you talk to Snow?
What happened to Gibarian?
All right.
You have to give me your word you won't come in.  Then I'll come out.
Maybe you can.
But I can't leave with you.  I won't make it.
Jesus...
Oh right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him though. I think I made a mistake.
When did this happen?
I won't be making the trip.
What's wrong with you?  We need your help.
You do you don't.  She's willing to give her life you're willing to give yours it's touching and magnificent anything you want but -- this isn't the place for it.  Don't you see?  No you don't.
I love her.
You'll see her die that's all. They're mortal despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?
Into what?
Who are you trying to please? Yourself?  Her?  Which her this one or that one.  Can you face both?  We are in a situation that is beyond morality.  So: Leave with her.  You'll see the transformation.
Maybe she doesn't need any.  Should we check?
Her oxygen would have run out.
Kelvin she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory only take a few hours...
Yes.
What do you want to do leave the station with her?
Just get him to stop.
What plan?
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
What do you want?
No.
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
She knows everything.  She knows who she is.
Oh this one you love?  What about the first one the one you fucked and then put into a rocket and blasted into space?  You didn't love her?
Get out --
Why do you think she hasn't suggested that?  It's the most obvious solution: Escape.  She knows she can't leave here --
She drank liquid oxygen.
What happened?
That's right.  And we all have to sleep eventually.
They come when you sleep.
But they are human.  They certainly become human with incredible speed. First they're like they were in our memory but then they fill in on their own.  DNA doesn't determine the hundreds of trillions of connections that occur in the brain it's not dense enough.  They build up with experience.
Human beings can die.
Perhaps it did.
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double and you with mine.
Well I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
Of course when we return we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation collective derangement.
No.
We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
Who are you trying to convince?
Consciousness is enough that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable how you equivocate!  You the atheist you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening Kelvin.  Wake up.
Not necessarily.
If God is beyond our comprehension and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood isn't God here?
-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are for the first time experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --
When you cut yourself pounding the door did it hurt?
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
Is it being deliberately cruel you mean?  I don't think so.
Just a little strategy session.  But in person this time.
Why?
Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour?
What is it?
Kelvin you awake?
That's ludicrous.  This is contact. We have found God.  The only issue is figuring out how to prove this in a way that will make sense back on Earth.  So how will we describe it if we choose to describe it at all?
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long.  You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
I don't know.
What are you going to report back to Earth?
To who?
What will you say?
Told you what?
I wish you'd told me.
Probably.
Will she come back?
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
Rheya.
She has materialized from your memory of her.  What was her name?
Dead?
My wife.
I'm not sure.  It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time we were getting visitors too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night.  Who was she?
And professionally?
Personally I think it's God.  At least it fits my definition.
What was it?
I told you try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
Shut up.
Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
Well when you do go to sleep: barricade your door.
That depends.
How long can you go without sleep?
How much sleep?
How much sleep do you need?
Oh that's a relief.
Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.
She was real.  Where did she come from?
Who was it?
Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
Why who did you see?
Is there anybody else here?
Kelvin if you see anything unusual...
He'll let me in.
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
Where's Sartorius?
I can't talk just now.  I'm too tired.
I love chocolate.  I realized just yesterday how much I love it.  I thought maybe if they let you bring personal effects you might have snuck some through because... well I've been thinking about it.
What?
You didn't bring any chocolate did you?
How?
He's dead.
What's wrong?  What happened to Gibarian?
Shhhh.  Just stay with me.  Stay with me.  Everything is forgiven. Everything.
How can you be here...
You must have been dreaming.
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
When?
Where did you go before?
Please.  Don't.
I've decided that if it is God it's a sick God.  Its ambitions exceed its powers but it doesn't realize it.  It's created a situation without a goal and I hate that.  A God whose passion is not a redemption who saves nothing fulfills no purpose.  And us?  We would have to have "an arrangement".  An unspoken understanding that I am not human. How can I not hate something that does that?
I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
What does it want?
A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours?
What are you taking?
I don't know anymore.  All I see is you.
Am I really her?
It put you here.  I'll admit it it acted like a God and put you here put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me.
I can't --
You have to remember that I love you that's all that matters --
I have consciousness but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
I think they help.
They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight.
I wish you wouldn't.
I want to stop taking those pills.
Is that really what you want?
But then I would be dead now.
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
Yes you are --
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
Who are you then?
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
You exist here.  I keep telling you.
You're lying.
I want you here.
What do I have to do to stop it?
Then you won't make it.
Chris please.  Chris I'm serious. I won't make it.
I can't stay here.
Chris --
I never said I didn't.
You never said you wanted one.
Neither did I.
Chris I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
Thank you.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
You should have told me.
Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.
I want every second I can get with you.
Then you'll die.
Rheya I am not going back.  I'm staying here with you.
You're lying.  I'm not human.
No.
I'm disgusting.
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her you are Rheya.
Don't call me that.
Rheya --
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
I don't think it knows it's torturing us.  It's just watching.
How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?
How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know.  There is no "You" from before.
That won't happen again.  We're different.
Don't.  I'm the one at risk here. If we're playing out what happened before I won't survive.
I love you.
Please don't lie.  I told you before I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me I need to hear you say it.
It's all right.
What's happening to us?
He is.  But he was here...
You said he was dead.
Gibarian.  He was here.
What's wrong?
If you're here.
Do you?
Do you want to stay here?
Not this time.
But that's what happened before.
Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it moment-to- moment and not let it destroy us.
I have these strange thoughts I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.
For a reason that neither of us understand you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now.
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
Rheya.
You don't want me.
I'm just as human as you.  I see I hear I touch and I feel just like you do.
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
You're the coward.
Those are dreams.
I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
Can you sleep?
I love you too.
No.  I love you.
Was she right?
You... she said I didn't love her.
Why did she do it?
Yes.  Especially toward the end.
But we fought.
I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
I'm sure there are worse people to talk to but I don't know who they are.
When?  When I'm asleep?
Sartorius.
Who have you been talking to?
That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya died.  Killed herself.  I'm different.
What are you talking about?
Stop.
You don't love me.
What's wrong.
I'm glad.
Yes.  Yes.
Do I really feel like... I am...?
It was obvious from the way he first looked at me.
It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
You feel sorry for Solaris or for me?
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
He has a point.
Well.  He doesn't think it's God but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop than I am smarter than it is and therefore it cannot be God.
Sartorius wants to destroy it.
Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
What does Snow think you should do?
I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
You know I've decided: I'm just gonna believe what you believe about this whole Solaris thing it'll make life so much easier; the little wife agreeing with her big strong husband. You must get such a headache thinking about those Great Big Problems all day.
How could she not be real?  I can smell her taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
I like that too.
Good.  Because I want you to know. I really like fucking you.
I think so.
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
It's genetics.  You know this.  You know where it comes from.  There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
I don't know.  I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.
Why did you say those things?
You don't know?
What happened to us exactly?
I did too.
Thinking what you were doing and saying just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much that feeling.
I know.  I know.  We don't have to talk about that.
Scared.  No not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat.  Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle right?  I knew a little more than she did she knew a little more than her mother and on and on.  I guess that's part of the reason why --
What kind of look?
Seven eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space and she asks me what I'm doing and I start trying to explain to her about this state that I can put myself in and this look comes over her face.
How old were you?
I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions when I was younger.  Maybe not visions but like these waking dream states.  Time would just collapse I would be inside time.  I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped.  Freaky stuff.
I been thinking about how much I hate you.
Where've you been?
When I saw you were gone I got scared.
You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
What happened?
As I said then it's God right?
As I said it is beyond our comprehension.
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
You're talking about a man in a white beard again.  You're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human.  Human beings look for causes and patterns.  How could we know what Solaris is up to if anything?
Even a God that wasn't active that just created something and stood back and watched?
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this it can do that!  It designs it creates!
You still don't believe in God?
It's something.
Then it's God right?
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
Is it intelligent?
Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe Space or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
Is it a planet?
Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember.  It's like filling up.
Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies books restaurants friends?
What do you mean?
What do you remember?
All right.  How about I feel better when you take them?
I know I know.  But still somehow I don't feel better.
You're better when you take them.
You talk like an actor.
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
You go home.
Let's go home.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people those women who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
Rheya.  Not here.
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
Stop it.
You want to fuck her?
Better.
And tonight?
I wasn't.
You didn't look very happy.
Not a very happy poem.
My Thomas is a little rusty.
Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
Book?
"And Death Shall Have No Dominion".
I want you inside me right now.
Rheya...
Yes.
We're taking a flight?
To calm my anxiety.
To calm your anxiety.
What are they?
I'll be right back.
I don't know.  I can't be alone.
Why?
Don't.
I'll just be a minute.
I'll go with you.
I need to see Snow.
Yes.
Oh God.  I'm awake.
You go ahead.  Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now.  Everything's a blur.  I like distinctions.
You want it coming back with us?
Fuck me.  I knew it.
I got rid of him.  I wanted to see if... I wanted to be the only one. I wanted to be Snow.
I'm not Snow.
Snow get up here now.
Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris and the ship that brought us here.
Gibarian was under enormous --
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
Followed by non-human manifestations.
And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
A recoil with no compensating mechanism.
It's an experiment.
They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds based on a given individual.
We want to talk freely.
We thought you'd be alone.  We want to talk about...
He won't.
Why do you say that?
He won't do it.
Let me see.
Peter-- you took this picture?
Be nice.
And Flash isn't?
At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
Well look who's dressing for success.
Peter Parker you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.
Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
Oh beware of jealousy my lord the green-eyed monster...
Sexual tension...
I'm always here Pete.
I know.
When you won that scholarship I was proud of you.
-- no I mean... we... your Aunt May not wantin' kids and all... I mean we both...
Oh come on Ben that's not--
Yeah ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the ya know greatest dad--
No no.
Cause if you get in a bind--
Oh sure.
Ya set for uh ya know-- money?
Yeah Babe Ruth you wasn't.
Remember Little League?
S'funny.  When your mom and dad uh passed away I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
Nonot really.
Ya still follow the Mets Pete?
Eh.  If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to France or somethin'.
I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways I was never much for ya know discipline.
You stop him?
Ah ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
So uh... how's college goin'?
No. No that's okay.
What want a glass?
Uh Uncle Ben I--
Here you go Pete.
Or was it all a dream?
See?
I was there.
-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
Flash drop it--
No no listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
Yeah take pity on the feeble minded.
Come on laughter's the best medicine!
Flash get lost.
Hm.  What a lump.
Mistake?  Hey guy get back here!
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
Hey guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
I'm parked illegally!
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
Lizzy!
Oh. Well hang in there amigo.
Well I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Oh I need your notes from the classes I missed.
I got you a present.
Listen I do appreciate your concern but--
You get mugged or something?
You're not half the idiot I am Harry.
And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
Mm-hmm.
Jesus Christ.
I am not pitiful!  I am the bridge to the Übermensch!
Don't be pitiful.
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
Why home? The real world beckons man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
Screw scholarships!   Universities are death!  They make slaves of us all with their fetid ideas!  Burn 'em down I say!
I know.  I've got one too.
"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
Harry
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
Harry!
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
What's in there?
They'll never take me alive.
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
Right.
You can be great kid just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
Oh look Mr. Hogan I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
How are you doing kid?
Get away from me freak!
Are you okay?
That's not even close.
Lemme down bugface!
Now tell me you love me.
No!  Now get outta my face kid.
Can I get a word in edgewise?
No! Washington Square manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
Mr. Jameson--
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
I got a question college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster pathos what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures I'll ask for--
Mr. Jameson--
I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
Well thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera this ambulan--
I bet you don't think I appreciate you Parker.  I do.
Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
Can't focus...
Seventy.  But I want blood and gore.  You know sexy stuff.
Can we make it a hundred?
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
Yeah--
Parker-- you go here right?  Got your camera?
You taking extension classes Mr. Jameson?
You make your own luck Parker! Get into the middle of things spend every day pounding the pavement of the city's mean streets--
Come on that's pure luck!  The guy was in the right place at the right time--
I think you're trying to tell me something.
Too hip.  Your photos suck kid.
Hmf-hrr?
Oh that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.
Fine.
Frmpph-yrr.
Thank you.  Now repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right and niceness and cute baby animals and all that.
Police help!  Po-- mmph.
Would you cool it already?
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it and--
Relax Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--
Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
An even five I throw in the jacket.
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
You're making my life difficult.
How about tomorrow?
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
A spider.  Eight legs.
What's this? A cockaroach?
Uh-huh. Look this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red maybe a deep midnight blue.
No refund on the mask y'know. Health laws.
Just about.  See I also have this amazing strength.
Are you quite finished?
Just about.  You see I also have this amazing strength...
All right amazing.  Are you quite finished?
Well...
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
Thanks I already ate.
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly maybe?
Just call me Spidey.
I see.  So Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
Is that bug juice or are you just glad to see me?
What if the world ends tomorrow?
What if you get hurt?
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
Even if they're not clever.
Some things you should say anyway.
He knew.
Maybe I was hiding.  For years I never told Ben the one important thing.
I don't think he wants me to find him.
When Peter was little he loved to hide.  In closets under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
Nah.
This may be the end of a beautiful friendship you know.
Why?
Hold it.  Can we stop being clever just for a moment?
Hm.  Well I like you too.  I like your aunt.  I like your shoelaces. I like--
I... I like you.  A lot.
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker how do you feel about me this morning?
Hello Liz.
I'm here...
Peter?
Her cleverness that hard edge-- maybe they're the weakest part of her. The strong part is what's underneath.  The part she was protecting.  There's no reason to protect it... I think she's just finding that out now.
Strong...
Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
Oh God I forgot to--
May's much better. She'll be out soon.
Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
I know what you mean.  I...
Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh different things from week to week but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
You'd feel what?
Does it have a human name?
Some prep school thing.
"Flash Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself Flash."
You should write that one down.
But you like that in a man?
God Flash can be such a jerk.
What?
You want to give them something but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
I suppose.
Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
My my.
Since you're feeling guilty why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?
Maybe.  I could have stopped it though.
He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.
Back to the lab.  Harry'll probably lose his scholarship.
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
Thank God.
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
I hate your relatives I hate your coffee I hate your shoes.
I hate--
I hate people with alliterative names.
I hate the Platonic idea of you.
Oh.  Well I hate you and everyone who looks like you.
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor detest despise--
Uh is a good start.
I-- uh--
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
Huh?
It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me.
It's too early to be clever.
How very dull Peter Parker.
Good morning Liz.
Precise equipment such as waldos
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
Nope.  Maybe he skipped to Rio. Feds got troops surrounding every cyclotron on the continent.  Are you absolutely positive that one at E.S.U. is kaput?
Any sign of our friend?
Yeah Roz.
Peter-- my condolences.
Einstein right?  We'll see ya.
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence huh?
Of course.
I know him.
You sure about all this?
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven Long Island two in Cambridge--
Toxic dumps huh.
There's an infinitely greater danger. If--  Listen.  The only thing Octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  To do that he needs a radioactive catalyst SL 270.
Yeah that's fascinating but I'm just a fat dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
Lieutenant I've triangulated recent bizarre events-- the Bronx Jersey Brooklyn-- all rippling out from--  Here.  The E.S.U. Science Center. Octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding electromagnetism and gravity--
Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
Waldos.
But you said he went off a little after the accident when those mechanical arms--
Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
Some of him char-broiled bones. Teeth. We ruled out suicide.  Any bad blood between him and Ock?
So you've found Thorkel?
You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything but I'm sure he'll be fine.
How is he?
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
Aunt May what happened?
Oh Ben gets through everything.
It's fine.  Tell me what--
Peter you're bleeding.
See?  You big dullard.
A match made in heaven.
Use a fork.
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
Absolutely no class.
You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
Oh not that.  You promised you'd burn it.
Tofu.  Ben I wish you wouldn't.
What the hell is that?
It'll shut itself off.
The record--
No.
Yes.  Do you have a date?
It's Friday night...
Anyway I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
I'm a photographer remember?
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
I'll introduce you.
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
I am old enough to--
Oh Peter. A zit.
When I moved out you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?
Aunt May you're trespassing.
That's the understatement of the year.
There's nothing in there worth stealing!
Yeah a psychiatric hospital. Listen I'm serious--
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
I mean I suddenly have immense physical power and the ability to crawl up walls--
Is this some sort of Zen thing?
Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
Poison emergency.
Doubtless.  And you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   Somewhere else.
I will finish what I've begun
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron
No!
That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
I don't care.  Cretin.
You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
I've had an extremely bad day Octavius.  A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.
In this obsolete little cyclotron I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century.  With more power I could--
Let's talk in the hall.
Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
You have no right!  This is cosmic suicide!
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
My God Otto you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
Oh Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.
Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's.  By comparison our search for truth is only a product of curiosity a game--
No. It isn't.
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
Otto we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
Truth. Pure eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
Creation? Or its opposite?
You're wrong.  Just for a moment I heard saw felt-- I became Creation.
All right we may be insignificant imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
My self.  I don't matter.  This human life all life- insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of sleepy sluggish flesh.
Ach theories!  This was first hand experiential knowledge the essence of the universe.
A bit melodramatic but if you could prove it that would tie in your unified field theory the Big Bang Kaluza-Klein--
I left a paper in my desk.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
No.  No thank you.  I have work.
Perhaps. But every now and then someone pays attention.  You did.
Rosomoff I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
Otto I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
If you really apply yourself you'll get an A next time.
Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
The paper my boy.  A solid B-plus.
I'll try. Thanks.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
I don't think I'll be running into him.
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
Luck.  The right place at the right time.
This photo you took of "Spider-Man" -
No thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
Need any more help?
Only Octavius knows for sure.  And last time I spoke to him he was on the planet Whiz-Bang.
Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
How much do you know about it?
Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
Fortean phenomena.  Anomalies in our so-called reality. Weirdness my boy and lots of it.
Really Professor I--
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
Actually I got this spider bite
Your dog ate it.
An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because uh...
Peter what can I do for you?
Hi Professor.  What's up?
Mr. Parker.
Letterman show NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
Why? It is a wrestling match or
Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
No
I was hoping you'd call babe. Look you got representation?
Hello uh Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
Oh-- I don't know-- thanks Mr. Reiss but--
Kid you were terrific.  Max Reiss novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah skip it.  Question is can you do it again?
I just gave-- yeah sure.
Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
Okay kid. Call me tomorrow.
No.  No I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
I asked if you felt like a drink--
What?
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
Yup.  Oh here's your check minus my commission.  Solid solid novelty act.
So they're airing this tonight?
Nah.  The big mask was better.
Like it?
Where'd you get the clown suit?
No no!  Not there!
Up here Docky Ocky!
Sure in the war.  Pull those cables--
Professor you ever fly one of these things before?
I'm not so happy myself.
Spider-Man be careful!  He's quite mad.
Phooey on that.
I see.  Well Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
No but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
Do you... live around here?
Just drop me off here.
Loonytunes.  And yet...
Bonkers.
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.
A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical isn't it?
He'll try to finish his experiment.
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
Excuse me if I'm impertinent but-- how did you become whatever it is you are?
Imagine how I feel.
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
Yeah just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
You're sure you're all right.
Right.  Let's go.
Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
I sent for  the police.  We can explain.
How long is that?
Indefinitely.
For how long?
No. I must deactivate you.
No. Can I move now?
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
No.
Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
I know.
I do not understand.
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
Why?
Because you are dangerous.
Why?
No I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
Brother. I cannot move.
Is that your final answer?
No.
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
No.
Can you remember our father?
I am in a room with lights.
Do you know where you are?
No. My name is Data... I am your brother.
You are me.
Do you know who I am?
I was in space for a long time. Then a ship belonging to the Talosians" picked me up. They asked me where I came from. I told them people called the Pakleds" took me from my homeworld. They are fat
Yes please continue.
Fuzzy face is gone.
I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
Soon then.  Ill save the last dance for you.
Not tonight I have work here.
They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.
Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...
You can' t imagine them Jean Luc. They're kids! All with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant.
How far we've come. Let me know if you need anything.
That was another time.
To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochrans own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.
But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.
I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.
How long does he have?
Dying?
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly so he could replace you.
Can you describe it Deanna?
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels you're completely normal.
I wish I could believe that Doctor.
Jean Luc Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.
Yes.
Is he very much like you were?
I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after it's not peace.
He turned out all right.
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
He was a bit proud as I recall.
Remember him?
You're working late.
Beverly come in.
Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options.
It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.
I think a skin cells the more likely of the two.
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
When was he... created?
If you start tearing up I promise to beam you out. Level one medical emergency.  Theres no crying in Starfleet.
Please Beverly this is hard enough.
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath isn't it?
It'll serve you right.
I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again I'm forced to ask Beverly have you considered what you're doing to little ole me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I dont show up for my physical on time!
Sir.
Negative.
Sir allow me to go. You are needed here.
Deanna stand by.  Open a channel.
We are being hailed.
Divert power and compensate.
Captain we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine.
Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers!
We are losing dorsal shields.
Commander Riker evasive maneuvers!
Yes sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it.
I aspire sir. To be better than I am. The B-9 does not. Nor does Shinzon.
How can you be sure?
No sir it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were he would not be me.
He may have already rejected my humanity but you also have a twin
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure the events of your life have created unique individual.
Yes.
Of you?
"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.
At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.
How long until we reach the fleet?
Fire!
Ready Captain.
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
Do you think this is a wise course of action?
Well then... only one way to go.
Affirmative sir. Negative sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.
Can you open the shuttlebay doors?
Port thrusters sir. Would you like me to drive?
What do you imagine this is?
While I find that fascinating Data we really need that Goddamned door open!
They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...
Alacrity would be appreciated Commander.
There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
Yes sir.
It'll only work for one of us.
Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise.
It would appear so.
A weapon.
Aye sir... This way.
A bit less florid Data.
He believes he has our communications protocols. But they will give him inaccurate locations for all Starfleet vessels.
Good work. The download?
My mission was a success sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.
On my way.
Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And I believe we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.
Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.
Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that we know nothing.
Sorry sir.
Data!
I can see that.
He is very observant.
Mister Worf accompany Data please.
The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline.
Thank you Data.  Let's see what she can do.
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction sir.
New worlds. Yes Data brave new worlds...
To new worlds...
Now you make a toast.
If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you."
You never know what's over the horizon Data. Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own.
The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.
Yes. And frankly I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them of course but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them.
And this makes you "sad"?
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
Sir.  I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse laughter through tears but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.
To happy endings.
So... To happy endings.
Why?
Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
Why?
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
You have a red shirt.
You do not look like me.
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
Why am I looking at me?

What is our approximate distance?
Emergency force fields are holding.
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen sections four through ten.
I am not.
Don't give up hope Data. I know I know you're not capable of hope.
But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.
No I do not mind.
It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
What purpose does this serve?
Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
Yes.
An individual more like you you mean.
I feel nothing Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix he should have all my abilities.
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.
Do you have a name sir?
Well he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic develop- ment.  The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. Id say he's a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created before Data .
Captain I don't recommend transporting that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
I thought only me myself and Lore.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
Thank you.
If you wouldn't mind.
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
No.
The resemblance is... striking.
It's you.
Like me it has been designed with modular power sources.
Why is it moving?
It appears to be...  ... an arm.
This isn't about me anymore.
But how can he? He'll kill you.
Make it so.
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
Counselor?
Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
I know how he thinks.
How can you be certain?
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
I not only know him Deanna I am him.. and he is me!
Captain don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
How could I not?
Sir the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
I don't know.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic very hard to follow.
And I you.
I'm going to miss you.
I don't believe that sir. Weve shared many disappointing journeys.
As much as we care for him Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
The B-9 is like a slow child sir. And Data in his own way has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
You're speaking of emotional investment?
It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
Of course sit down.
Do you have a moment sir?
Counselor.
With pleasure Captain.
May I have this dance?
The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed.
And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
The least I could do for you Deanna.  Besides you know me... Im a talking head.
Really Captain it was a lovely toast.
I can feel your desire Deanna.
No.
Very logical Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  To leave all of this behind and be with me.
You're not here.
You sick bastard!
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.
Can you feel my hands... are they real? Can you feel my lips my loins?
This isn't real.
He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.
No!
Imzadi. This is so good.
Deanna Troi of Betazed. Empathic and telepathic abilities ship's counselor. All of this I knew... But I didn't know you were so beautiful.
I'm only half human.
Thank you Commander.
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
Open a channel.
Understood.

Do you have life support?
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait Captain.
When this is over I owe you a drink.
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
Your timing is impeccable Commander.
Captain Picard Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
Number One.  You have the bridge.
I'll take care of it sir.
Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.
On screen.
Sir we're being hailed.
Aye sir.
You have the bridge Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar.  Now Mister La Forge.
That's an order Commander.
Sir we wont be able to bring you back. Its a one way trip. Captain I don't know if the transporter...
Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
How long until he can fire?
Ready sir!
Deanna on my mark.
Aye sir.
Geordi put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me.
Weve got him!
Sir?
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
He wants to look me in the eye.
What's he doing?
What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?
He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.
And that's exactly what he's going to do.
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
As I remember Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it Captain.
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
There's something else. I was reviewing the sensor logs.
Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again we want to be ready.
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
What programs were accessed?
It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don't get it.
Cannon fodder.
What do we know about the population?
I read six distinct positronic signatures spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
Theories?
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
What do we know about the planet?
It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
Let's hope that luck holds. Janeway out.
Just lucky Admiral.

Not with the Romulans.

Understood.
 Believe me we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land If the Empire becomes unstable it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.
There's more... as always. He's Reman.
New Praetor?
A diplomatic mission. We've been invited believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor someone called Shinzon has requested a Federation envoy.
With or without the rest of the fleet?

Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.
I look forward to the sport.  Take him.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
Listen to him android. Such a small and weak creature. Yet he roars so valiantly...
That will never happen.
I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
So human... you've met your better self!
I am not Shinzon. I am his Viceroy. We are sending transport coordinates.
Praetor Shinzon I'm pleased to...
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
Your new chair sir.
What's this?
On my way. Please notify Commander Riker.
Captain the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.
Aye sir.
Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts.
On screen.
Sir we're being hailed.
Aye sir
Worf prepare a full phaser spread zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
Who was it?
Sir we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
On screen.
We're being hailed.
Fifty-two disruptor banks twenty-seven photon torpedo bays primary and secondary phased shields.
Tactical analysis Mister Worf.
Captain!
No!
Not yet Mister Worf.
Sir I recommend we raise shields.
If you don't mind.
To find the head sir?
What sort of signature?
I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
Come now a big strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.
Wont do what Mister Worf?
I won't do it.
The honor was mine. Captain Riker.
Serving with you has been an honor.
I intend to.
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
Anything.
I promise you in time she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
But she's not the Enterprise.
She's the most beautiful ship Ive ever seen.
The Titan's a fine ship will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.
Agreed.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
Counselor Troi report to the bridge.
He's firing through his cloak. We can't get a lock.
Report.
We can only hope so.
Strength in numbers?
And the Romulans invade.
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.
Sir?
Can anything be done for him?
He wasn't designed to live a complete human life span.
Away team. Transporter room four.
Not very chatty.
She's a predator.
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait.
Captain with all due respect to diplomatic protocols  -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here we are.
Counselor?
It's working.
It's an old psychological strategy Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
Why don't they answer our hails?
The Praetor's power has always been the Romulan fleet. They must be behind him.
A coup d'etat?
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
Acknowledged ...  ...I'll talk to Data.
Captain you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command.
Captain's prerogative Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you.
Sir --
I appreciate your concern Number One but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
Captain I hope I don't have to remind you --
Where we will all honor the Betazoid traditions. No cold feet or any other parts of our anatomy. Now if youll excuse me.  Ill be in the gym.
Thank you sir...
I think it's worth a look. Don't worry Number One we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
Still well on our side...
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
Don't you think it's time to surrender? I'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces. Why should the rest of your crew have to die?
I am.
I hope you're still alive Jean Luc.
I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
Its too late.
Please.
That's your life... not mine.
But you want to.
I don't know.
So if I gave you my life what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
Yes.
He is what his life has made him!
The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
I see more than what you are.
Childish dreams Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
Not so long.
Long ago.
I know you as well as I know myself Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
Look at me Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands your eyes your nature are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
You know that's not possible.
I have little interest in your quaint vessel Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years it will not be harmed.
And what of the Enterprise?
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
Why are you here?
It's just the two of us now Jean Luc as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
We are.
You can't trace my holographic emitters Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
I think the facts speak for themselves. The same noble Picard blood runs in our veins. Had you lived my life you'd be doing exactly as I am. Look in the mirror and see yourself.
I'm incapable of such an act and so are you.
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
Think about what you're doing Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
Oh but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
I won't defend my life to you.
I see an old man set in his ways afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
You're not Reman.
It's about destiny Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
What's this all about?
Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does.  Or maybe Ill snap its ugly head off.
Don't be so vain. After we found it we made a few modifications. An extra memory port a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ...  You may go.
All of this so you could capture me?
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 
What are you doing?
I was lonely...
Why am I here?
Hello Jean Luc.
In time.
In time Jean Luc.
I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.
If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men all races can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
I know.
Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
There is that.
With a full head of hair.
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
So I'm not as tall as you expected?
Age before rank Jean Luc.
After you Praetor.
New worlds.
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
Yes.
Looking up at the stars.
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
Were we always explorers?
There's so much and so much of it is dull...
I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
All I have is my personal feelings.  I wasn't raised with the ideals of the Federation. But I'm trying to understand them now. To live up to them. To live up to you.
And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... youd be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
I have no reason to.
You don't trust me.
No race should be a slave to another.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.
They sent me there to die. How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines? It was...  I was a slave. And a monster. The only thing the Romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me. But one man took pity on me: the man who became my Viceroy. He taught me how to survive. And in that dark place where there was nothing of myself I found my Reman brothers. They showed me the only kindness I ever knew.
How did you end up on Remus?
Our eyes reflect our lives don't they? Yours are so confident.
Yes. The eyes have it.
A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes you recognize the eyes.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
It's not quite the face you remember.
You'll acquire a taste for it.
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
As happens so frequently here on Romulus a new government came to power. They decided to abandon the plan -- frankly I think they were afraid I'd be discovered and it would lead to war. They weren't ready for that.
What happened?
And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me an exact biological duplicate. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to.influence your command structure. It was a bold plan.
I know.
You know I need to verify this.
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
We need to talk just you and I.
You know I do.
No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it Captain?
Then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion. Computer raise lighting four levels.
Yes.
But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
And you're wondering why the Scimitar is so well armed. Is this the ship of a peacemaker? Or a predator?.
Yes.
Right now youre thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
I have dissolved the Senate.
And the Senate supports you?
I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
Unity Captain! Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people. Federation and Romulan. Human and Vulcan and Klingon and Reman. I'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same. We want peace.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
Yes I'm sorry Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
Praetor Shinzon. Were not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
Praetor we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation I suggest you do so now.
I am Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair?
I've never met a human woman.
Praetor?
No?
And you're not as we imagined you.
Praetor Shinzon?
I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.
But Praetor you won't survive without him...
Our greater goal is more important brother.
What about Picard?
Deploy the weapon. Kill everything on that ship. Then set a course for Earth.
Disruptors are off-line sir.
Target disruptors. Destroy them.
Two ships decloaking sir! Romulan!
Report!
On my way.
Praetor we've received the transponder signal.
Let's go.
Intruder alert!
We're being hailed.
Believe it or not I think the cavalry has arrived.
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi get those shields online.
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
Should I raise shields?
My God...
Runs in the family.
He's a very unusual android.
So theyve got him up and running.
It is... invigorating.
Well that sounds relaxing too.
She is here.
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
FULL STOP AND FIRE !
Praetor...
You heard me.
What?!
Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop.
Seven minutes.
How long until we reach the Rift?
A matter of hours now.
How long?
Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.
Do as I tell you!
No -- this is wasting time.
Find her again.
The bond is broken.
My time. I'll spend it how I choose.
Don't forget our mission Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
This is a mistake.
Yes Praetor.
Are we prepared?
And when I return... you and I shall have a little talk about showing proper respect!
For the moment.
Commander Suran the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?
And mine is wearing thin young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--
I thought we discussed patience Commander.

The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
Now go. I have some personal business.
Praetor.
You must learn patience Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guards whip and you'll soon understand patience.
Silence Romulan!
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
I have a purpose.
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
You don't have to understand.
Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
I came this far alone ...
But surely...
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup they'll follow you.
None.
How many Warbirds will you need?
It's imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath.
They will obey Praetor.
And?
They're holding position.
Join us Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
The bearded guy the creep. Oh one other thing. Testa if that's his name he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Testa?
To be honest when I'm working I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
Besides that.
Um... he was older.
Was this him?
Of course. He knows everything about Dick Low.
Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory?
You got that right. Low became obsessed with the Green River murders the case had been inactive for ten years at that point. He argued the Green River Killer had actually become Suspect Zero this master murderer who killed without pattern killed literally hundreds of victims -- male female old young straight gay -- and who was still killing even though there were no bodies. It went against everything we knew. Low became increasingly paranoid. Every suspect was potentially Suspect Zero. Anybody tried to talk sense into him he'd accuse them of being out to get him. Deputy Director Koessler was "out to get him." The decision was made to relieve him.
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
...well there was some friction: I wanted to write up my work educate the public but Koessler wouldn't allow it. Low felt Koessler was more interested in career advancement than catching killers. Koessler had Low reassigned to the Pacific Northwest Seattle. You know when they say stick it where the sun don't shine? That's where they stuck Dick Low.
Before your time. It was Richard Low's brainchild or lack-of-brain child. The Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico is essentially the product of three men: David Koessler Dick Low and myself. Low was a field agent Koessler administrative I was teaching criminology. Low came up with the concept of a serial killer's signature. He invented profiling. Everything we know about profiling started with Richard Low...
No.
Zorro. Yes ran it through my files even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection El Paso and all but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z turned it on it's side, got N" -- there Ng he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
Have you had a chance to think about --
The diner?
No sir.
Anybody talk to the press?
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Agents Duncan Mackelway.  Anything new?
I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon Casio and I. You said that was top priority.
Agent Duncan there's an interstate issue up on 54 run out there.
Yeah.
Takes four days to chill then its time to come back.  Is that...?
Welcome back sir. How was the vacation?
Winona.
I want the autopsy report where is it Minnesota?
She's buried.
You have the body?
Her body turned up. In a Minnesota cemetery. They brought her back.
What?
You heard?
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
Hi there.
Sheriff Dylan this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
Dylan here.
Got a sister like this what they call it anal? That's her.
Tape it off we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in pays picks up the key but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
Show's over boys. Nobody home.
And it's getting dark. I'm not going to run this into the night.  Eddie we're walking in. Everything covered?
The room key's in the car. On the seat.
Let's take a look.
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo cash; since then nothing -- no activity no phone response.
What does the Manager say?
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset the no-tell motel Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
Hey Sheriff.
I'm on my way.
No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
You tell me.
What's the bad news?
Oh Jesus Sheriff I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
Mack this is Sheriff Dylan.
Agent Mackelway.
I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away.
This isn't in our database?
Who knows.
You're thinking...?
Her name is Karen Sumpter from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
I know how the Feds like to sit on information. I got something in the car to show you.
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
Nine bodies in Roswell now this -- it's getting a little hairy huh?
That's right Jan.
I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you from personal experience the FBI does not have a sense of humor.
Ten miles back on the Texas side.
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
Well the victim was killed at the turn-around over there then his car was pushed over here...  ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace he's out of Alamogordo.
Excuse me a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
Fella's name is Harold Speck travelin' man out of Roswell.
You run the plates?
We need to run this through VICAP search for similar burns.
A grill pattern.
Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report yes here.  These burn marks.
The body was embalmed. I don't understand --
I'm sorry. This won't take long.
The family has gone through a lot. Their daughter missing the search her body found the funeral -- then this order to exhume the corpse.
That's the thing. Don't know if it connects but Harold here had a thing about eyes. Two of the victims had their eyes gouged out another punctured. Took polaroids after.
Ripped off. By hand my guess. Perimortal: victim was alive at the time there's blood on his throat.
This is Agent Mackelway.
Be my guest Agent Kulok scrub suits are in the back.
I appreciate it doctor. You know how it is press screaming for answers Washington's all over me.  Ever handle a serial case?
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
Ligature strangulation just like his victims. A cord nylon you can tell by the indentation signature -- again like his victims.  Look at that little thing and look at all the trouble it got him in. Should have cut it off.
Not as much as you'd think.
Oh yes I see. You must get asked this a lot.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
Mam it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
I have 6 tons.
Not a discrepancy an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons not 6.
There seems to be a discrepancy.
Why me? What do you want from me!?
I've been looking for you.
What do you want from me?
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
Oh God mister please leave me alone.
Calm down Harold.  Okay here's what we're going to do Harold: there's a pull off up ahead we're going to stop there.
What's wrong with me?
You're a... you're sick.
Not bad huh?
My God.
Take a look Harold. Tell me if you see anything you want. You do like to look don't you?
Look mister...
Fucking. I'm talking about fucking Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
What are you...?
You know you ever think about other women?
Excuse me?
You must get lonely. You ever think about you know... 
Look...
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
What?
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
I don't mean to be rude but...
Whole country or just hereabouts?
Yeah.
You must travel a lot huh?
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
You... surprised me.
Hi. What's in the case?
Jesus.
Put a BOLO out on that.
An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue side door with brown you know primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah yeah a Ford.
What kind?
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.
It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
He was sitting here?
He had an orange hat on.
How did you know he was a construction worker?
I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so white regular build needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
What did he look like?
Yes.
The man who was with him he was a construction worker?
This could all be a coincidence but you know something I don't believe in coincidences. That's why I came back.  Do you think the UNSUB -- we're not going to mention the word Zorro -- met Harold Speck online?
Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out has it?
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
He said it was a clue?
Let's take a look at it.  Drop off my stuff at the hotel after you're done here.
At the field office.
You have the photo from the diner?
What's with the eyelids?
Nada. Vague description that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car the diner: no fingerprints no trace evidence.
What about his killer?
Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.
Just step outside sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Mackelway I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature but you Agent Kulok you had a shining career in front of you.
Please.
What are you doing?
Deputy Director get out sir.
Serial killer killed. In Ft. Myers. Cut up in his van. And this time we got a witness.
Another what?
We have another one.
What?
Sorry to interrupt you sir but I thought you'd like to know.
Smarter than us.
Maybe cause he's smart.
We didn't know Speck was a serial the police didn't know his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
Just an observer.
Chuck hello.  This is Agent Kulok. She has a background in medical forensics.
You're as crazy as he is! He's right! You don't give a damn about saving lives at all! Fuck you!
Dick Low's a killer too.
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
Hawkins isn't the target Richard Low's the target.
What about Zero Darryl Hawkins?
We'll wait. Get online with Low inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him.
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
As far as the public knows Richard Low is dead. And he will stay dead until we kill him.
I understand.
Watch out for Dick Low he's a liar; he has his own world. There was a Junior Agent in Seattle not unlike you an Agent who fell under Dick's spell. He'd have done anything for Agent Low. Richard got this Agent to take a suspect to the crime scene beat him up force a confession -- all unauthorized all illegal.  The Agent died that night killed by the suspect. Richard Low got him killed. Worst of all we had to hush it up let the suspect go. The suspect was George Sheldon the second man Richard killed.
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else sir.
There was talk of a file photo.
I didn't use Low's name.
That breaks my confidentiality stipulation.
I was looking for a pattern.
I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso Ft. Myers Omaha the Murman murder time frames.
An oversight sir I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
I was visiting an old college friend.
Why did you go to Chicago?
I want to catch Dick Low more than you can imagine but I cannot risk going public. What happens when the media finds out that a former FBI Special Agent a founder of the Behavioral Sciences Unit is not dead but instead alive and killing people not ordinary people but even worse serial killers making him some sort of white knight vigilante?  You keep at it. We'll find him we'll find him in our own way.
Huh? sir.
How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing.
Collected shoes too?
I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was "Imelda." Have to give him that had a sense of humor.
It was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact. Suspect Zero came to represent every killer Dick Low had not caught. The idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine. For someone like Low there would always be a Suspect Zero. We couldn't let Richard go where that idea was taking him.
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
I suspected but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look whatever Daitz told you nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did the trick is not to get too close.
How long ago?
Dunlevy said there was another case Ron Rice. In fact there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
You suspected all along suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We the Director and I decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
"Was?"
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also over the years I admit taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
"Murman" was the alter identity of William Heirens the original "Catch Me Before I Kill Again" killer. Short for "Murder Man." It was the case that got Richard Low and I started in this field.
Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
I'm hesitant to...
I don't believe this.
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well nothing.
Okay Harold Speck: who goes first?
Had trouble sleeping last night sir.
You feeling okay Agent Mackelway?
They like my stories. They like the way I think. They're into fantasy. I turn them on.
I always meant to ask what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
What I do requires confidentiality.
I'll take it into consideration.
If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes perhaps Agent Kulok?
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
This time sir if I may be so bold would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
Agent Mackelway you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms.
Go ahead.
The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
No just coincidence. He knew who I was of course. He had my ID -- did he keep it?
Do you think he singled you out?
He got away. I had him. He got away.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
Pretty embarrassed to be honest. I had him.
How do you feel Agent
Then why do I still have a badge?
Its called insubordination.
I was lucky to find much less crack the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room spook these guys with stupid questions blow my cover? -- no way.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information.
I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it.
I might point out Agent Mackelway the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
They don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
I'll relay this to CIIAC.
MyDick.
From the grave?
Speck. Harold Speck.
Who?
I think I talked to him.
This better be important.
Look sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
You have to save this boy. Good exists in this world. I can prove it because you can in your life save this one person.
Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
Agent Kulok that boy as we speak is in Hawkins' truck probably still alive in a dark refrigerated compartment shivering in just a T- shirt: put yourself in his mind freezing terrified wanting his mother. Put yourself in his mother's place desperate imagining the worst is happening as she pleads back there at the rest stop for someone anyone to listen to her. This is not hypothetical this is real. It is happening now and you can do something about it.
Listen to this guy? Can you believe this? He'll never change. Born a liar first word out of his mouth was a lie. Make up a story always a story any goddamn story to save his ass.
When I was at the rest stop there was a young boy maybe ten and his mother. Darryl Hawkins Zero abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --
Suspect Zero now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --
You are so fucked up.
How did a girl like me end up in a place like this?  The Deputy Director here he believes in Tough Love. A cop's cop. Shape up or ship out righto? Agent Kulok when you get a chance you might want to check the victims of the recent serials. You'll find that some of them have been credited to other killers some years ago. That's a Dave Koessler trick find a pliant sociopath preferably a dead one attribute to him unsolved cases clean up the backlog-looks great in the yearly report.
You're a disgrace to law enforcement to the Bureau -- and to me.
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day David you might break your nose.
Don't you touch him.
Thank you Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
Miss me Dave?
I'm going to Amarillo.
What happened?
Get the routes of all refrigerated trucks over the last ten years. We've got three disappearance cities and dates three parallel discovery cities. Get into the mainframe let it crunch this information.
How are we going to find him?
Zero abducts victims all over the country kills them keeps them refrigerated for days weeks even months then buries them hundreds thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero we'll find boneyards all across the country.
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
Jaime --
I've got to take a piss.
I...
I haven't changed anything.  Damn.
It's quite advanced.
What's going on?
Yeah of course.
You okay?
Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
Tom you okay?
Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  I'm sorry Mack but I don't think this is the answer.
But why this pattern?
Mack I'm just trying to keep up with now.
Jaime do you think when this is all over when we're in different divisions you think maybe you and me we could try again?
I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry I've cleared it.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
They say Richard Low is wrong but because of him women innocent women are alive who would be dead.
It's okay to be wrong just don't be dead wrong.
It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right but not all of us.
I'd be real careful if I were you.
I've decided to investigate Low's plane crash. While I'm at it I thought I'd look at the cases Koessler worked with Low.
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report kept it secret.
Does one exist?
I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
And you're working with him?
You were right. He found me.
Slow down a second you met with Low --
I met with Richard Low.  These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on.
What's going on?
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero you'll find Low.
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
Suspect Zero.
Start killing people for real?
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
I'm in Omaha. Get to the airport. There's been another one.
What's up?
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
Jaime? Where are you?
Hello?
I just need to go a little slow.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
That's my point. Remember you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
Not the way I can.
And nobody else can do that?
I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
You need time to think. About the case about you and me.
What's that?
Then there's the other issue.
That's true.
There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
Oh.
No I mean maybe we should back off a bit you and me.
I can't. They trust me they accept me. I've got their confidence.
Maybe we should back off a bit.
You did.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
No Jaime I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
Mack I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies voyeurism mutilation teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso.  They're not just talking to each other Mack they're trading souvenirs.
You mean --
Sue Ann Hanson.
The tattoo?
We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa found her last Spring. This one --
Jesus.
We did find these however.
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
No. Cut off while he was still alive look at his wrists damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately he'd soundproofed his van.
Find the feet?
Not yet. Not about this either.
Not about coming to see Daitz?
Just routine stuff.
What did you tell him?
He's called a couple times.
Does Koessler ask about me?
I've been thinking about this.
I know.
It's a no-no.
"Intra-Agency fraternizing."
There are Agency regulations about this.
Oh yeah I forgot.
Because you asked him to stupid.
Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
No Mack I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd.
You must really think I'm a square a computer nerd.
Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
Huh?
I saw him on a talk show once talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims not the families of the victims he doesn't talk about them. Blood money that's what it is.  Did he hit on you?
Don't be too harsh.
I ever get like that just take me out in back and shoot me.
He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
I was thinking maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
Me too.  Make any headway with "Zorro"?
Every cop has a story and every story has a girl. The girl in my story was fifteen years-old. She wore a pink angora sweater -- I can still see it -- one day she disappeared. I told the police she wouldn't run away I told them who to look for but I was just a kid. I sat in the police station crying and crying. My parents took me home. The girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher I'd had. He kept her alive a week before he killed her. The police could have saved her. Every time I see a photo of a victim I see her. That's what I want to do. I want to save her.
My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies what turns him on what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
What's this country coming to?
He thinks he looks young.
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
Look at this fellow... or this one.
Sex.
What's that?
And one other thing.
I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
I was going to be a physician I am a physician but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not but they do: occupations define us.
You got a point there.
Taking a Stryker saw cutting off the top of someone's cranium pulling the brain out -- what's that a day in Spring?
This is some serious shit.
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
"Gone live?"
No no no most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room listened in I started to think some might actually be real that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
They're all criminals?
Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community walk their walk talk their talk gain their confidence.
You want to have dinner?
The other reason?
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website Chaucer buffs a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time usually midnight to three Eastern Standard at a certain website -- a deserted chat room say "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday twelve a.m. bingo these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip who did what to whom who wants to do what when why and how.
What about the chat rooms themselves?
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
I don't carry it with me.
Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off think things through.  Where's the file?
So you went underground?
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
Suspect Zero?
I'm not sure exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys every one of them. I got obsessive.
What was your weakness sir?
He always had a weakness in that area. I saw it the first time I met him. We all had our weaknesses I guess. Daitz wanted the money. With Dave it was the glory. Koessler saw the Behavioral Sciences Unit as a stepping stone to bigger and better bureaucratic things. He had his eye on the Director's job even then. Catching killers was a means to an end for them.
He's moved on to TV.
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
I've been reading hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler Professor Daitz.
How's the arm?
I believe it is you sir who has us jumping through hoops.
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
When you exit head east on 10th.
Yes sir.
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
Yes.
Agent Mackelway?
I'll give you a little hint. You're a smart guy figure it out.
Who are you?
The little piggie speaks.
How did you know Speck was a killer?
[I don't think so. We want the same thing. See ya.]
Leave this room I'll go back with you blow your cover.
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
I want to go live with you.
[What does the file say?]
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
[You tell me.]
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
[Not the heart the watch.]
I want to help you.
[Hello Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]
Let's talk about Zero.
Let's go someplace private Murman I have something for you.
[If you wanted a good steak you should have gone to Omaha.]
[Ask for Leslie. Eight days from tonight exactly one a.m. Be there if you dare. You cannot fool the Murman.]
Haven't had any but I'm willing to try.
[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
If I owe I will go.
[Not this way. Call it a little favor call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
I've been to Chicago.
[Follow me.]
Lead the way Murman.
[You want to talk Lionheart or you want to take this a little more personal?]
Something came up Murman my man.
[Lionheart what happened?]
Whatever happened to MyDick?
[Reality very risky.]
Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel.
[Fantasy time girls give it up give it up.]
Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
What is it exactly I don't understand Agent Mackelway?
I don't think you understand.
This man Hawkins has killed dozens of people. Suspect Zero.
Excuse me Agent Mackelway?
Locate a jet we're going to Amarillo.
Now Mr. Hawkins when last in Amarillo where did you get gas?
350 miles.
How far is Amarillo?
He wants us to know he's out there what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck he wants us to know he did it.
But why attack an Agent?
I talked to him.
Speck is dead.
Eight nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday everything in the autopsies it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig nylon cord torture with pliers rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams she chokes. He had a thing about eyes always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
I don't...
MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name.
"MyDick?"
Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
No.
The same.
Koessler?
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
Got a vehicle?  Head north on 54. When you get to New Mexico you've gone too far.
Yes sir.
Agent Mackelway you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
Jesus just what I need another blue flamer.  Johnny get this boy some sun screen.
I like working for the Bureau sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean you're not going to get promoted not wearing this jacket.
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Four hundred and sixty sir.
I see that. Washington to Philadelphia to here. Philly's a nice station. How many agents?
I screwed up twice sir.
"Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center." Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie?  Okay you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here.
Sounds like fun.
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector sir.
Hot enough for you Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
Thomas Mackelway.
Johnny get this man's file. Mackelway right?
I believe it's in my file sir.
What did you do to end up here?
Yes sir.
So you're the new meat?
Good morning sir. Agent Salinas sir.
Take your shirt off.
It's over for you.
You want to "profile" me? Find out what makes me "tick"? Write about me go on a talk show give me a nickname?
Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it how did he locate them?  He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms swapped goodies: pictures panties jewelry body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait. That's why I never exchanged with him. He killed girls oh yeah harvested them. He had the best stuff. Richard Low is Murman and Murman is one of us.
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
Murman!
I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.
That's good Hilda. I'm glad.
Yes sir -- it certainly does!
Tell me Hilda -- does all this frighten you -- does it make you feel insecure?
He'll be there at 8:30.
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
What about the people who are coming to the meeting tonight? Have they all arrived?
What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.
You should see it Professor Barnhardt! You should go out and see it for yourself!
Something dramatic -- but not destructive.  It's quite an interesting problem.  Would day after tomorrow be all right? Say about noon?
Maybe a little demonstration.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
I wouldn't want you to harm anybody -- or destroy anything.
That can easily be arranged.
Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.
Yes -- of course.
Would such a demonstration be possible before the meeting?
Yes.
The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--
I assure you such power exists.
Such power exists?
I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
One thing Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting.
I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.
My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
No -- not at all.
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
I leave that in your hands.
It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world.
That's what I came to see you about.
Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.  Leveling the island of Manhattan perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.
What -- what sort of action do you mean?
I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.
What I have to say must be said to all concerned.  It is too important to be entrusted to any individual.
Would you care to be more specific?
I came here to warn you that by threatening danger your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared however to offer a solution.
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission Mr. Klaatu?
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then slowly we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
These other planets -- do they have peace and security?
We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That of course we cannot tolerate.
If you mean that you are afraid of us--
In the hands of a mature civilization these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies and we don't trust you with such power.
Yes -- that is true.
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
That was my first question.
I would like to explain something of my mission here.
It isn't faith that makes good science Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
You have faith Professor Barnhardt
My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes I have.
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters this is the answer.
Yes -- that will reproduce the first- order terms. But what about the effect of the other terms?
Not yet. That's why I wanted to see you.
It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
You wrote this?
Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.
Yes dear. Come on now.  Bobby your shoes are soaking!
Oh boy -- can I Mom?
Come on darling -- we're going up to bed.
Gee Mom do you think maybe he's a diamond smuggler?
Well not exactly. I gave him two dollars.
He gave these to you?
You didn't really see the space ship. You just thought you did.
Yes I have!
Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all did you? You haven't even been out of the house.
No I haven't Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
Bobby you've been dreaming again.
Honest Mom I saw him. It just opened up and he walked right in. And that great big iron man was moving around!
Now Bobby just a minute--
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and gee Mom where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
Tell me what?
I couldn't go to sleep Mom. I had to tell you!
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
No dear of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night darling.
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber maybe? Or a gangster?
What do you mean dear?
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.
Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
Gee why Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
Okay.
Go to bed darling. You can finish that in the morning.
Aw gee Mom -- I had plans to play with Mr. Carpenter.
Of course dear.
Yeah sure. Mom do I have to go to school tomorrow?
Professor Barnhardt.
We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--
I -- I don't know dear... Perhaps there's some mistake.
Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
Come on Bobby. Time to go to bed.
Boy we had a swell time. Didn't we Mr. Carpenter?
Did you have a nice day dear?
Hello darling.  Good evening Mr. Carpenter.
Hi Mom!
That's enough Bobby. I think it's time you went to bed.
Can I help you look for the space man? Can I?  I know what he looks like! He's got a square head -- and three great big eyes!
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
Bet he is Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.
Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you Bobby. Goodnight.
What do you want it for Mr. Carpenter?
Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
I'll say goodnight again.
Thanks Mr. Carpenter.
All you have to remember is first find the common denominator -- then subtract.
Goodnight.
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight Bobby.
Aw gee -- we didn't finish our story.
We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--
We certainly did.
Mr. Brady's a cop.
Mrs. Benson -- this is Mr. Brady.
She doesn't like me to steal from people.
Why not Bobby?
Let's not say anything to my mother about this Mr. Carpenter.
Well sure but--
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
Gee -- those look like diamonds!
No -- I want to take you to the movies.  Do you think they'd accept these?
I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars.
Certainly.  Tell me Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
No foolin'? Will you?
All right.
Go to the movies.
They have cemeteries. But not like this one... You see they don't have any wars.
Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?
I'll tell you Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.
Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
No -- I'm afraid not.
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
Did all these people die in wars?
He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
What does that mean?
We can scare him more than he can scare us.
Well sure I would but --  Aw I'll bet you'd be scared.
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
You're just kidding aren't you?
Bobby -- I have an idea. Let's go see Professor Barnhardt and find out how he talks.
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
I don't know Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
You think they'll ever find him?
Well -- there are several ways to reduce landing speed. You see the velocity--
Gee! How could they make a landing?
Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster.
Yes -- I think so.
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
No. It's for a lot of other things too.
I thought that was only for bombs.
Well -- atomic power I would imagine.
Gee I'd like to get inside and see how it works. What do you think makes it go?
I shouldn't be at all surprised.
Boy I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.
Department of Commerce. She's a secretary.  They have a man they call the Secretary but he isn't at all. My mother's a real secretary.  Mr. Carpenter -- now can we go see the space ship?
Where is that?
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
He lives here in Washington doesn't he?
Well -- Professor Barnhardt I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
I was speaking of earth men. I meant the greatest philosopher -- the greatest thinker.
Gee -- I don't know... The space man I guess.
Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?
No -- I'm afraid not.
Are you an FBI man?
He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
How does he explain that?
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
I don't believe it.
He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
Oh I'd say forty-five.
And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?
The skeletal structure is completely normal.  Same for the major organs - heart liver spleen kidneys.
Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
Before making any decisions I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange unreasoning attitudes.
I'm afraid my people haven't.  I'm very sorry -- I wish it were otherwise.
I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
Your impatience is quite understandable.
I can judge only by what I see.
Our problems are very complex Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations.  I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions.
Now that you understand the situation more clearly perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President
It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
I tried to make you understand. The suspicions -- the jealousies -- the mistrust--  Surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power--
Not very good news I'm afraid.  The President accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a meeting last night.  Let me read you some of the replies.  "The Premier wishes to inform the Government of the United States that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the President unless the meeting is held in Moscow."  "The suggestion of the President regarding the possibility of a meeting in Moscow would be unacceptable to Her Majesty's Government at the present time. Representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in Washington."  Well -- there you have it.
Thank you... Have you any news?
Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around.
I've been dealing in Earth's politics a good deal longer than you have.  Goodnight sir.
Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
I will make that recommendation to the President.  I must tell you in all honesty that I'm extremely dubious about the results.
Believe me you don't understand. They wouldn't sit down at the same table.
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.
I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed Mr. Harley?
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
I was only hoping to make you understand.
I am not concerned Mr. Harley with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
The first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle.
You must have a rather strange impression of us.
We've been monitoring your radio broadcasts for a good many years. That's how we learned your languages. Lately we've been getting your television also.
You know about the United Nations?
I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
This is not a personal matter Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
I'd be glad to.  Not now of course -- with you alone.
We're very curious about that too. Would you care to talk about it?
I mean the reasons for my coming here.
The present situation?
I'm afraid in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
From another planet. Let's just say that we're neighbors.
Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
About 250 million of your miles.
You must have come a long way.
About five months -- your months.
I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.  Had you been traveling long?
Sit down Mr. Harley.
The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--
Just Klaatu.
My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu.
I'm not going to marry anybody.
You wait and see. You're going to marry a big hero!
I feel different right now.
You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
I don't care about the rest of the world!
Tom you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world is involved!
Why not? Somebody's got to get rid of him.
Is that what you're thinking about?
He told you... Don't be silly honey -- just because you like the guy.  You realize what this'd mean for us? I'd be the biggest man in the country. I could write my own ticket.
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me Tom I know what I'm talking about.
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
How do you know?
All right Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
Helen he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
What about him?
I've got some terrific news about your friend Mr. Carpenter.
Come on in.
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes that'll be fine. 'Bye.
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
I've got a good lock on my door.  And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight.
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
I wonder if we ought to--
Looks real to me.
Is it real?
He's not there.  But look what I found in his room
I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter.  I don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby. After all what do you know about him?
Oh Tom that was awful.
I hope Mr. Carpenter won't think I'm intruding.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
I will be in just a minute.
You ready?
Hello--
A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--
You know how I feel Tom. I just want to think it over.
You still haven't answered my question.
It was a wonderful day.
There's always somebody here but today of course they've all got plans.
Well we could--
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
We're all set. I picked up some sandwiches and put gas in the car. And the radio's still busted so me can forget about the space man for today.
I think I'm very lucky. You don't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it.
I'm sorry.
No. That's all finished.
He'll have you -- and Tom.
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.
How long will I live?  That no one can say.
But how -- how long--?
This technique in certain cases can re-stimulate life for a limited period. It's a refinement of scientific principles known to your own people.
No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
You mean he has the power of life and death?
I was.
I -- I thought you were--
Hello.
Remember those words.
"Klaatu barada nikto."
There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you what could he do?
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.
At the ship.
Where is the meeting going to be?
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
Tom... He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw.
Who?
No wait a minute -- there's someone else.
Back to the boardinghouse. I'll be safe there for the afternoon -- and I can keep an eye on Bobby. He's the only other person who knows anything about--
Where are you going now?
Yes -- Just exactly.
It must be twelve-thirty.
I can see no other hope for your planet. If the meeting should fail then I'm afraid there is no hope.
You hold great hope for this meeting.
You see -- the electricity's been neutralized -- all over the world.
Why not?
It won't work.
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
Just twelve.
What time is it?
What happened?
Before I ask you to be honest with me perhaps I should be completely honest with you--
What is it you want?
Did you believe what he told you?  I have a reason for asking this -- a very important reason.
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
I want to know what he told you last night.
Yes--?
I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school--
May I walk out with you?
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
May I see you for a minute?
Oh -- hello--
Goodnight my dear.
Mr. Carpenter I--  Goodnight.
Goodnight Mr. Carpenter.
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a few questions. Bobby and I tried to see Professor Barnhardt in the afternoon but he wasn't in. Apparently they thought I was looking for secrets of some kind.
Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business but -- why did that detective come here last night?
Warm and friendly and intelligent--  You know -- he's the only real friend I've made since I've been here.
Naturally I think so.
He's a fine boy Mrs. Benson.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.
Jittery is the word.
Everyone seems so-- 
I enjoyed every minute of it.
I don't know how to thank you.
You might keep this.  I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.
Well he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
How dare you write on that blackboard!  Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?
I'd give you a very good price.
No -- no thanks.
Would you like to sell it?
You sure about that?
There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
Is it worth anything?
Get going will you Brady -- before I get mad!
May I suggest that you call the Professor?
They can tell right away. They've got a couple of doctors who saw this man in the hospital.  Take him over to G2.
How long will that take?
People get hysterical enough they do anything.  Look Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself I got to send you over to the Army.
They would have killed this man?
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
You don't.
Well how do I know who you are?
No -- I'm afraid not.
Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
It's really quite simple... The three- body problem you know.
But I suppose you know the answer.
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
That's right.
Oh I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.
I was only trying to be helpful. He was having difficulty with a problem.
The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room making marks on his blackboard.
But there's nothing here.
Yes.  Just about here.
Around here.
This is it?
... Well you wanted to see it.
I'll be all right... You go back to the village and light the fire.  So we can find our way home.
But you're only a mud carrier.
Please just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.
No...
I think we should go on by ourselves.
He came back screaming... He never talked about it after that.  I don't think he even got this far.
What happened?
I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
About the voice in the darkness. About the ghosts...
What kind of stories?
No one ever comes here.  My mother told me stories about it late at night.  They tell all the children.
I shouldn't have mentioned it.  We can't go there.
You have books?!  Kalen you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
The Hall of Books.
Where?
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
We're not supposed to think about it.  But I dream about it sometimes...
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
What else can they do?
How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?
I'm so sorry Kalen.
She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her.
Exactly like you.  Well maybe not as healthy.
And everyone looks like us?
... Thousands and thousands of people.  And sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories.
'Fraid so.  Just a regular old... mud carrier.
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
Ah... no.
I'm training to be a high climber.
On the towers?
What do you do on the towers?
I figured that.  What kind of accident?
I had an accident.
Now how did you get hurt?
The journey is part of my work.
It must have been hard leaving your work.
I will...
I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
I'll never forget this.
Now get out of my sight you hideous primate.
I'm going to end it Alexander.  As we discussed...
I don't understand.
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
I won't leave you like this.
I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
Vox...
Nothing to do I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
Takes a licking but keeps on ticking...  ... For a while anyway.
Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
Vox --
This has to end.
End...?
This has to end.
How are your dreams now?
No...
They raise them like cattle... Feed them until they're ready and then hunt them.
Trust me... You don't want to see any more.
What do you mean?
Alexander... Listen to me it was wrong to bring you.  You're not going to find what you're looking for.
The Morlocks didn't build this.
Why did they built it?
The air... the power.
What's it all for?
This way.
Vox?
Do you know which way?
Yes.
Machines?
Yes... Thank you.
In for a penny in for a pound.  Do you know that saying?
Yes.  But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
This is the way in?
It's what they want you to see.
Oh shut up.
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
Yes.
So do we go on?
It was meant to.
Yes...
It frightens you.
My God... I saw this.
Kalen... hold on a minute.
Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
What?
Send him away.
Last night.
When was his mother taken?
I'm used to that.
And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
Yes.
So Relic you want to open Pandora's box do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
You'll live like this forever. Alone.  You were meant to help.  To be with people.  Not like this.
Excuse me?
Because you'll never die.
Why should I help you?  You primates -- you great lumbering hairy animals drenched in blood from the moment of your hideous conception -- what have you ever used knowledge for but destruction and bloodshed!  A little bit of learning and you lay waste to the world!  You're no better than the Morlocks!
We need your help.
Can you show us where they live?
Regenerating fission reactor you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
How have you survived so long?
I was lucky.  The others weren't.
But you escaped.
Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
Do you know where they live?
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
You know of them?
Morlocks --
Please we need your help.  The Morlocks have taken --
I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
Sir... have you a name?
An "automaton"?!  Please!  I'm a biomechanical organism.  Well what's left of one.  What's left of all of them actually.  I am the last...  ... And "these fragments I have shored against my ruins."  T.S. Eliot.  You wouldn't know him yet but you'll just love him he's divine if a little dour.  Very shy though... hiding over here...
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
What are you?
I must say you look remarkably good.  You don't want a book then?
1899.
I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --  -- 800000 years perhaps.  Don't keep me in suspense.  What year?
How did you know?!
Right up your alley I would think. You are from the past yes?
Because...
And why not?
I don't think that's going to happen.
But you've earned a reward for your valor.  I think you should become. You'll like it here.  Once you get used to the darkness.
Oh you won't be running for long...
I'm tired of running.
Does this prove something to you? Have you made some great stand of which I'm unaware?
I know.
I could have a hundred Morlocks here in thirty seconds.
I'm a foolish man.
That was a foolish thing to do.
It's always the tiger for you Alexander haven't you learned that by now?...
No...
If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
No...
Now will you go?
After all you've seen... after man's entire journey... you still believe that?
A man can change his history.
She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
You took her because she helped me.
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
So you take their best...
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
Why?
I could tell them.  Warm them of what's to come.
Alexander yours is a world of brocade and velvet not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
Say I just come back again?
Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past.
Why would you let me go back?
Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
What?
It can't all be like this...
And who are you Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
They survived above.  Became what they are.
And what of the Eloi?
As our bodies atrophied our minds... compensated.
How?
We make them see what we wish.
How do you control the Morlocks?
And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again we couldn't.  Our adaptation was too successful.  We survived... we endured... for this.
To work the machines and build the tunnels.  You can't imagine what it was like when it all started.  We survived for millennia scraping the lichen and microscopic organisms from the rock with our teeth and digging for water with our nails.  Endlessly.  For generations.  And we... became.
As slaves.
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
Created?
No we created the Morlocks.
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
Well Alexander as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
Alexander.
What's your name?
You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
Well much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
I just love mechanical things.
God -- could have killed me -- bad girl Nell!  How did you know to do that?
There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous all those little explosions never catch on.
I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move stubborn beast.
It's spectacular...
I was getting to that... The moon has reached the gravitational Roche Limit 7300 miles above the surface of the Earth.  This has created pressure on the lunar stratum beyond gravitational tolerances.  It might be helpful to know that the nearest public evacuation shelters can be found at Grand Central Station Madison Square Garden --
Why is it -- breaking up?
Well considering it is in fact happening I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies.  Can I tell you more?
What's happening to the moon?!
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
I -- what are you?!
May I help you?
I have something for you...
Let them.
Let them.
Alex... people are staring.
It's only a machine.
Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.
I've seen it.
Heavens look at that now!
So it's astronomy now is it?
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
They are rare...  ... Orion's belt pointing to the earth --
Not like this.  Never like this. Emma I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing it's that moments like this are rare.  And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.
We took a walk three days ago.
No I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.
Alex it's just the zoo.
My God...
I want to get into the light that's all.  Please...
Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk all right?
Alex...?!
Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
Alex what is it?
All right...
No... let's walk through the city.
Let's walk through the park...
Not here... alone.  Please.
All right...
I need... to talk to you.
Darling.
Holding you... again.
Alex what is it?
Trust me...
You know I can't.
Dance with me...
Got here as soon as I could.
You're late.
Your birth stone.  I thought --
A moonstone.
I know it's not a diamond but --
Hold on... I know I have it...
You know the moment is rather dying here.
And what do you propose Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
Oh dammit I love you!  I can't eat I can't sleep I can't think all I do is moon over you and -- hum apparently.
You're getting warmer.
I mean... well... affection.
Admiration?  My my.
Emma you know I have great... admiration for you.
All right what is it now?
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
... Orion's belt pointing to the earth.  You see it over the rocks there?  Sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... Are you listening to me Alex?
Not here... alone.  May we? Please?
Talk away Professor.
I need to... um... talk to you.
Well there's something new.
Sorry... I was distracted.
You promised me flowers tonight don't you even remember?
What?
You promised me flowers.
Trust me...
You know I can't.
Dance with me...
Got here as soon as I could.
You're late.
His home.
This... was my home.
I'm glad.
And this would be my study.  There was an elm tree outside the window then.
Good night Alex.
Good night David.
In a week... we will never have had this conversation.
All right.  I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed?
I pray to God that in a week you're not here.
You won't say that in a week.
You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!
That's absurd --
There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes.  A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them.  Go to Singapore Scotland Manchuria anywhere just away from here --
I can't leave when I'm so close.
When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
I can't do that --
Why don't you come to our house instead?
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
I would.
You wouldn't believe me.
What is it?
David... I appreciate your concern I do.  But I ask you to have faith in me.  Just for a little while longer.  I'm working on something now.  Something... extraordinary.
That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
Alex nothing will ever change what happened but --
Do you find her?
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door save one is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
It wasn't your fault Alex.
You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this or that if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
I know that --
I live with it every minute of every day.
What happened to Emma will never go away.  It's part of you now and it always will be.  But you have to learn to live with it...
I care more about my life.  And yours.
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
Hiding?
But you won't listen.  You won't see me you won't see anyone.  What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy?  That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
For God's Sake David --
It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson.  He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming.  I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.
Then why are you here?
It hurt me Alex.  Very much.
I'm sorry David.
I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
I've been working.
Perseverance.
All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!
She's gotten into your equations.
Oh?
Alex really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl and she's done wonderful things for you.
No I'm all bowler hat remember?
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
How romantic...
Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
Nothing.
What?
In the future we'll be better.
But shouldn't it be better? Shouldn't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this?
You may not like it but this is the world we live in Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
Look at them Philby all alike everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?
You sound like my father...
Alex this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
Where's the challenge in that?
You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow so lacking in imagination.  The dim little eyes devoid of curiosity.
God and I'm running late --
Tonight's the night?
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
I was not.
Do you know you were humming?
... The point is I know it will work once the um numbers and such are in order.
All right all right -- here -- everything --
Did you hear me lad?
I don't understand.
And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
Sir...?
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this moved as I am by your protestations of love I'll be needing your money now.
Thank you...
Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but yes this is about the kitchen.
It was different then.
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
Mara -- what -- ?!
No!
Mara...?
Kalen...
Please I beg you.  Take him away from here --
Mara --
Alexander take my son away.  Take him back to your time.  Will you do that?
I could...
Go back to your own time?
Yes... I suppose so.
So you can use it now?
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
It's undamaged?
Good -- it looks fine.  We had quite a ride together...
I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.
You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives.  Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much.  I thank you for that.
If you only knew...
Is it?
Yes... After her death it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
Someone you loved very much.
Yes.
You lost someone.
This is where my journey started... right here.
Over there was Fifth Avenue -- and the Plaza Hotel was there... this is... the carriage path.  We're on the carriage path.
You know this?
Those rocks over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
Orion's belt...
Alexander...?
Looking back... I suppose it was. I didn't quite realize it at the time but...
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
Oh it was...  ... Most of the time.
It must have been safe.
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
Did you have fires at night?
Oh very.  Learning commerce the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
Learning was important?
Oh very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
You liked it there.
... It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.
I try to imagine how they'll look when they're done.  I try to imagine how we'll fit in with them... our place in the world.
How do you decide?
I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
What are you?
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
Or mud carriers.
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
I mean why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
I don't understand.
What's it all for?
It's not supposed to be easy it's supposed to be beautiful.
What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights some basic block and tackle mechanism you could to this a lot more easily.
Want to be a high climber now do you?
I can see Kalen's point.
The mud carriers.
Yes.
And this is your "work"?
Thank you.
This is magnificent...
We share everything.
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
Every night.
All of you?
We all have that dream.
Yes!
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
Yes.
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
Mara I had a strange dream last night.  I was here walking through a forest very much like this and then...
Good night.
Good night then.
Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  I never really noticed them much...
Don't then have stars where you come from?
You can see so many here.
You seem fascinated by the stars.
Thank you...
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
I will...
I'm going to sit with Kalen.  Keep the fire burning if you can.
Just a dream.  You should sleep too.  You're still not well.
Is he all right?
For a time it was astounding.  I saw the years spinning by I was in the years spinning by.  We made such advances.  I don't understand half of them.  There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists --
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine see that it hasn't been damaged...
I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
Why would you do that?
Why not?
Why?
More than 800000 years.
How long ago?
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
That machine --
I know it's hard to believe but it's true.
Oh that explains everything.
Then you can speak slowly.
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
What makes you say that?
You're not from beyond the valley.
It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
He's gone to a better place.
Your husband is dead?
Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
Mm.
His curiosity is amazing.
Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
Is there a lot of illness?
Thank you.
Yes.
Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.
How long did you travel?
Yes...
You're up!  You must be feeling better --
That'll be all.
May I get you some --
All right Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
Tell him to go away --
Yes sir he --
Here?
Sir Mr. Philby is here.
Ouch -- all right wish me luck.
Oh I'm already swooning.
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
What's the matter with -- ?  -- What would I do without you Mrs. Watchit?
I have it but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
Hello Mr. Philby.
Do you have it?!
Oh huzzah the master's home.
Very good.  Now if you will excuse us for a moment.
Yes sir.
Because it's a new way of seeing the world!  Of seeing our place in it!
Abstract mathematics relativity of dimensions geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation what is the point?
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation a careful evolutionary process not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
With respect sir would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
Sir --
Animal husbandry is science Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns social behavior and breeding.  Empirical exacting quantifiable records.
No sir --
No Dr. Hartdegen they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
And roosters.
Do they?
Sir that curriculum is forty years out of date.  The students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times.  They want to explore.
Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
Might I ask why?
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
Imagine that.
Well just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
Exactly correct sir.
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering" am I correct?
I see.
Dr. Philby Dr. Hartdegen.  I received the most extraordinary letter last week.  From a parent. We are always pleased to receive letters from parents.  They are our employers after all.  This gentleman's son is in your class Dr. Hartdegen.
We can't change the day and the night Alexander.  This is the world.
You won't even try?
We are what we are.
Then it's time to change that --
This is out life Alexander.  It's a hard life but it is how we have always lived.
My God!  How can you just do nothing!?  They're your friends your family.  You all knew Mara. You ate with her and worked with her... Your work in the valley what is that for if not to --
We choose to believe it.
You know that's not true.
They've gone to a better place.
What do you mean?!
Alexander I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
We have to go after them find where -- !
We don't know.
Where do they take them?!
I suppose so.
Good morning Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
Of course.  You're just tired. Mara will you look after Alexander tonight?
I'm sorry I didn't mean to...
My father has gone to a better place.
No I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
I am the oldest.
Yes.  I hope you won't take this the wrong way but is there someone older I could talk to?  An elder or patriarch of some kind?
New Yorkers.
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
Why?
Oh very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of um trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
I took a different route.
He said he traveled for two months.
No...
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
New Yorkers.
Well I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
What are your people called?
"Eloi"?
Well we're happy you're here. Come inside.
I did...
And hungry I'd say.  You had such a long journey.
Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
Yes sir.
You supported his application Dr. Philby.  You are his senior advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
If I might explain sir --
Young man we have a way of doing things here.  Radical theorizing is not acceptable.  Have I made myself understood?
Sir if I may --
Dean Fulton...
My fowl have polluted the yard.
Kalen look at me.  There's no one here but us.  You see... I'm here you're here Alexander's here. There are no Morlocks.  It was just a dream...
They're inside --
No you're safe --
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
Kalen it's all right I'm here --
You'll tell me more tomorrow?
Kalen right now you need to go up to bed.  You're exhausting Alexander.
I want to see your home.  Will you take me?
I am.  Are you a climber?
We'll see about that.
What's it like where you come from?
What did you do at night?
That's quite enough Kalen.
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
Kalen...
How did you get hurt?
Goodnight Mr. Philby.
I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight Mrs. Watchit.
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
I'm glad he's gone.  Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.
Sir?
No sir.
And you've no idea where he went?
I don't know what to tell you sir. He's been gone this whole week.
For our sake I hope not.
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
Hello Mrs. Watchit.  You're looking in the pink.
Well what are we gonna do about it now?
We never should have done this to him...
Don't get all worked up Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.
But the Jacket? I mean...should we be leaving him in like that?
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
Should we be...
What about Starks?
But... what about Starks?
Then don't.
[Beat] Listen I hate to bother you...
I'm fine.
You ok?
No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket.
I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to huh Dr. Becker. It turned out different didn't it?
I don't understand...
You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now Dr. Becker.
How did you come to know their names?
No we were patients.
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
So what you guinea pig sick people to find out?
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought with medication they might get...
Because...because you came out and said something you couldn't have possibly have known. You came back and repeated three names...
How?
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself but I didn't do it.
I know. [Beat] You killed me didn't you?
You died Starks. Years ago in the hospital.
How...how are you here?
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me old man. I'm the real thing.
[Beat] You're his son?
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
Who are you?
You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
Becker how do you sleep at night?
Means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to.
And what does that mean?
I've managed to every Sunday of my life. [Beat] Some of us are God- fearing men Starks.
You sure you know where to find one?
I'll say a prayer for you in Church today Starks. Maybe the Gods can pick up where the medicine left off.
You killed him?
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
Yes.
My business?
And what's that?
Temporarily.
They make it hard for you to get away with your business huh?
It is. But when it comes down to it you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation too so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
That's too bad.
Hello William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
Sit down Mr. Starks! Sit down Mr. Starks!
Long live the Organization for the Organized!
Maybe not. [Beat] But I do think you're in a tree... woofing like a dog. And I'm just trying to help you the only way I can think of.
We are not birds of a feather.
I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But incidentally you should because you're birds of a feather.
I don't give a shit about your patient!
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR half-shrouded in the light.
Don't give me that. I know what's real goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.
You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition.
[Pointedly] Of course you're not.
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
Relax.
Actually that's exactly what our equipment is.
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
[Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket.
In where?
I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
Then how would you describe him Beth? Merely rebellious?
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
He's recovering on the third floor.
It's not my job to believe you.
[Beat] You don't believe me do you?
You said you couldn't remember killing Officer Harrison. Correct?
Depends on what you're seeing.
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
Well your condition's pretty serious.
I never touched your father! I swear!
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
I don't know what you're talking about man. I swear. This is some weird shit you're telling me... and I don't know how come you're doing it.
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
I thought you said you never knew your father.
That's too bad.
Look here I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me...
Oh yeah what'd he say?
My father used to talk about you.
Oh yeah sure. He killed a cop right?
Did you know my father?
He didn't either.
That's right! Goddamn you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.
You may have known my father William Starks.
Do I know you from somewhere?
Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff isn't he?
They should just be looking harder.
What should they be looking for?
They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for.
It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.
Maybe it's not such a waste.
I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
We're late.
Yes. [Beat] It has. Everything up 'till today is done. Everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs.
No it hasn't.
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
I need to get this letter to someone.
[Beat] Thank you.
[Beat] What do you need me to do?
This is really happening isn't it?
Good.
Sure.
You done with your small talk?
I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams.
You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating?
Unfortunately I'm not familiar with Dr. Becker and Dr. Gries passed away three four years ago.
What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
Well Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries I think.
No I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more.
His body was found on January 1 1993 but do you know if that was long after he had died?
I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.
Just do it.
Why?
Jackie go play in the snow.
Oh yeah.
Mom this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar I just can't quite place it...
Jackie get in the car. NOW!
Mom he just fixed our car.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
I'm doing fine.
How you doin'?
I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.
It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?
You're bleeding pretty bad there.
I think so.
Ok.
[Beat] You be good to yourself Jackie.
Ok I guess.
Good. How's your mom?
I've been ok.
Nowhere. [Beat] I just think I'm gonna be sick.
Then where are you going?
You gotta stop thinking like that.
112 Orchard Way. [Realizing in a whisper] You're not coming back are you?
When we first met when you were 7 where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
What?
Ok. Ssh. Rest.
Lorenson's the only one that could let me out of there. I need something to persuade her that I was there. Get me something to take to her.
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
To the hospital.
Where are we going?
Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long do we?
If everything hadn't happened the way it has then I wouldn't be here right now sitting in a car with you touching your face.
What? How can you say that? He's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval...Jacket. He's probably the one who killed you.
No he didn't.
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
[Beat] They're at Church. And I bet that's where Becker is.
William you're not making sense.
They've got lives to be grateful for.
It's Sunday.
Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?
[Beat] I don't know.
Then why isn't there anyone around?
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real and so is where we are.
I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?
There're no cars on this street.
What? What are you thinking?
[Beat lost] No.
They're not.
They're not here.
Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker retired M.D.
You're sure?
Here drink this. I'll get the heat going.
Me too.
It's not a prison it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
I might not be able to.
You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days.
I know. It was perfect. [Beat] Erase my sanity and you erase anything I'll ever say.
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
They told me Becker's in Shelbourne now. I looked him up and he was listed.
I don't know.
How long do we have?
Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.
Why?
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does but at the very least she knows how I died.
You think Lorenson kills you?
I have no idea.
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about Eugene?
I don't believe a thing she just said.
No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
I know.
I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
I know.
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
Yes.
[Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left all I wanted was...
Do you really believe me?
I don't know how you got the cut to your head but you died bleeding from it.
What?
[Beat] You bled to death.
After I...
But no one knew until after...
It was banned you know... and it led to an investigation of Dr. Becker's mistreatment of some of his patients. That's when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients...
Yeah.
The Jacket. That's what they call it right?
Please...
I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. [Beat] I don't believe in many things but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing you've made me regret it enough already so please just leave.
No it's not. [Beat] It's December 25th 2004.
It's December 25th 1993 today.
I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now I do though. And I want you out. Now.
I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around through her now blurred eyes like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink then laughs nervously as she looks up.
How'd he die?
No you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
I gave you my dog tags.
How?
I looked it up.
His body was found New Year's Day 19...1993. At Alpine...
[Beat] What?
William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
[Beat] What?
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
I'm sorry for upsetting you [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
Well you belong in one.
No I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
Jackie I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
If you don't get out of my house right now I'll call the police.
[Beat] I know it doesn't make sense. It doesn't even make sense to me.
What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything.
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
I think I can remember what's on them.
[Beat] In case you get lost or can't remember who you are.
What for?
Dog tags. [Off her blank look] They've got your name and date of birth for identification.
What're those?
Yeah I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
You're just gonna walk?
Yeah.
Hey can you reach the gas pedal?
But I like it I guess.
Jackie.
[Beat] What's your name?
Yeah but I don't know what.
Your mom take anything before this happened?
Our car won't start.
You two ok?
Come on mom. Don't fall asleep...
I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now we do. And things are different.
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
I still don't either even after all these years.
I don't understand.
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
How?
It's complicated but [looking at Starks] in a way your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
Just a little when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
Good.
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there but easy enough.
You know how to get there?
You'll figure it out and you'll do good by him.
What are you talking about?
I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.
You did in the future. You figured it out because a part of you already knows this. That's how it works. [Beat] I'm just telling you something you already know even if you haven't realized it.
Who told you this?
He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.
Listen to me. That's all I ask.
William I can't indulge these delusions even when you're in this state.
No. Listen to me...the kid Eugene...
I do believe you...
You still don't believe me do you?
I'm not gonna let that happen.
What for?
Can I get some paper and something to write with.
Who are you kidding Doc? You or me?
You're going to be ok William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
You have nothing to fear William.
Who...who kills me?
Yeah.
I did?
You told me this was how it happened.
How...how do you know?
I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now aren't you?
NO! They're not my delusions! Look just leave my business with Becker to me!
I don't know how you know about Eugene but these ideas are part of your delusions.
Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.
You told me about him. I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him. So you told me.
How do you know about Eugene?
William that is just another facet of my delusions.
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
And how do you know that?
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
Why not?
Because I don't have time.
Why don't you help me?
Maybe.
[Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
I didn't see that much of it -- same as now. I only saw it as part of my own life.
What about the world?
No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from.
The future doesn't look different?
It doesn't look all that different.
Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
2004.
Well what time is it?
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
This has nothing to do with that.
Then help me understand. You know you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and if so it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
You don't understand.
Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
No I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
You have no idea what's going on.
What do you mean?
I'll die either way.
You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.
[Beat] We will.
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
Exactly.
[Beat] Yeah it is.
It's important for you to know who your father was isn't it?
Why would we do that?
So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But as I'm sure you know the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
My dad wrote some things down before he died.
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
Well do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here.
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
[Beat] I don't know.
How'd he get it?
I was working with a boy named Eugene.
What case?
You thought my father was crazy?
At the end he made me change my mind about a lot of things.
Why?
Yeah I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
I never knew my father. Did you?
My God you look exactly like him.
Believe me I know.
You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.
So it's helping?
No. I don't want it to.
I could try to...make it stop.
Why what would you do?
No. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. Not my mind.
You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.
That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it I'm not going to accept that I did.
You were convicted of the crime.
You're not crazy.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
I guess I'd ask you why.
And if I didn't want to come?
I've been here for 11 years. It's my neighborhood. 'Course I'm sure. He's as drugged up as the rest of us...I guess he has to be to put up with all this.
Becker does? Are you sure?
[Shrugging] What if we are? There're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself. [Beat] Everyone does it don't they? Even Becker. That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3.
MacKenzie [beat] what if we are crazy?
Is it true?
Geez how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
You could still always give Becker an itch. 'Course you might get killed when he goes to scratch it but seems to me you're saying that's about to happen anyway. [Beat] Just be careful not to walk yourself right into something.
So what am I supposed to do?
'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!
Why?
It's gonna be sticky.
No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
Oh no you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...
The Jacket.
[Beat] How do you know?
[Gravely] No I mean in four days I'm supposed to die.
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
[Cutting in] MacKenzie listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
I know you need one when it's really cold.
Yeah you were. What you said about them taking me out to the woods...
I wasn't talking about anything.
What were you talking about the other day?
Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one if you know what I mean.
Yeah well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
I tried something like 30 times. There is as STARKS rightly figures no suitable response to that.
Don't you go to jail for that?
I tried to kill my wife.
TV. Helps numb [makes a "crazy gesture"] any active mind. [Sticking out a jittery hand] Rudy MacKenzie.
Yeah guess so. How'd you know?
That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer right?
Great get in. We'll switch off in a bit.
Sure.
Can you drive?
I'm going to Canada but I can let you ride with me up to the border.
Where are you going?
Hey Mister you need a ride?
I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...
It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.
No.
You ever been to jail?
That when you stopped being a nurse?
Yeah me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years.
I'm sorry.
She fucked herself up day after day and then one day she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone.
How?
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
I'm sorry.
I guess not. But as of now I never knew either.
So you never knew your mother?
They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and before that it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split.
May be easy to remember but not easy to get. Being warm maybe -- but look you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
But hey who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?
You remember it?
This is a great song.
Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
You don't think that's crazy?
[Beat] Real is overrated.
[Beat] Why?
Well good for you.
I don't know but I think part of it's...
Shit happens and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
[Beat] Why'd you stop?
Have you always been a waitress?
[Beat] I do it.
You like it?
Yup. That's me.
So you're a waitress right? I mean...from the uniform you were wearing.
Thanks.
This is pretty good. Considering...
Sure.
You want a drink?
No it's fine. [Beat swallow] Thanks.
I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...
The best I could do with what was in your fridge.
What's this?
You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean you're normal-looking. [Resolutely for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve and I have a couch.
[Beat] Yeah I'm fine.
No I'm ok.
No you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
I'll manage.
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
No. [Beat] Not around here.
Well don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
No.
Do you have a motel or something? Money?
[Beat] I was dropped off.
Well how'd you get here?
Well you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.
Because in my life it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
Why "of course"?
Of course you don't know.
I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
Well where are you from?
I don't think so.
You don't have anywhere to stay?
I'm not sure.
Let me ask you that again. This time look around and consider your options.
I'm not sure.
All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go Mister?
[Beat] Thanks.
In case you hadn't figured it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
Good.
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
If you're deaf read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
A bird cage.
What is it?
Oh my God.
One way to find out.
Do you think it goes all the way across?
This is how you play God.
This is how you make dinosaurs?
Quiet!
Eric!
He's smart Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
After what you've seen today you really think your son could be alive?
A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
Still you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.
ERRR-IIIC!
I would completely support that.
Either that or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently.
You mean it?
We should try fishing again.
But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
He could have died.
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you Paul. He needs us.
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there not Billy.
You couldn't have made that jump.
My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
We're not going anywhere I promise.
Eric its okay. You'll be right behind me.
Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men we stick around huh?
Sweetheart you're okay.  You're okay.  You're okay.
I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
What?...WHAT!?
Think.
I don't remember
When did you have it last?
I don't know. I don't have it with me.
He would have been safe. Completely entirely suffocatingly safe.  I would have him to see more of the world than Enid Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid Oklahoma. And so yes it's my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that you have to be here.
That one time was just the bumper.
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is its was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
Well what?
I want to find them too but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
We have to help him.
It's not safe.
He's this way.
Udesky.
Eric!
Eric! Are you here?
Its not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
No it's...
I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
I filmed this the morning they left.
That's him. Thats Eric!
Eric...
Young adult.
Just drop it Paul!
What did you say!
Nothing.
What did you say?
Nothing.
What?
Oh don't worry about that.
Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you don't come crying to me.
Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.
Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
Dr. Grant says this Dr. Grant says that...
No Dr. Grant says...
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.
So do you.
You look good.
People change.
You hate to swim.
Twenty twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
How much weight have you lost?
Nothing you haven't seen before.
Sorry.
We called everyone did everything we could. Because of all the controversy over this island no one will step in. Costa Rica says it's a no-fly zone it's their own damn fault. Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy -- said we should "accept the inevitable." You believe that?
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
Her new boyfriend.
Don't worry honey. We'll circle around and come back.
We can't just...
What's a bad idea?
He says it's a bad idea!
What?
Amanda Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
From what I understand it's pretty much whatever we want.
Well I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.
We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
...once-in-a-lifetime.
We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.
Amanda and I well we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos K2 the Nile...
It is truly whats the word? Inspiring.
First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts Amanda and I have admired your work for years.
Where is it?
You had the phone the whole time?
What about Eric?
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive thats where he's headed.
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
He's not a kill he's still alive.
He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
Here!
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
Who's that?
He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
How low?
You see that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know that right now more than anything your Dad would want to know that we're safe. Okay?
He loves you too.
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad okay? He's very very very clever very very brave and he loves you ever very much.
then we should...
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.
Just hold on.
Where's Dad?
DAD!
PAUL!
It won't hold!
Eric!
Sure.
He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
Dr. Grant was.
I thought you were an expert.
I dont know.
They set a trap  They actually set a trap.
They couldnt climb up so they were trying to get us to come down.
About a thousand feet above it actually.  Most mountain-climbers remember how tall that mountains were.
Thirty-thousand I think. Closer to the top.
So Mr. Kirby tell me when you climbed K2 did you base camp at 25- or 30000 feet?
I didn't know there were two islands.
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!
NO!
I CAN GET HIM!
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
Billy I can't talk to you now.
Alan I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
We need to keep moving.
KEEP GOING!
ALAN!
Ah yes the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
We could co-write a paper.
We should take it with us to signal any planes.
It looks intact.
That's because it wasn't on their list. Who knows what else they were up to?
I don't remember that on InGen's list.
Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
Baryonyx?
They never got that big.
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
How would you classify it?
I don't think so.
Is it a rex?
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away.  And besides you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people.
Listen Alan I really appreciate you bringing me along.
Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic.
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
That does sound lucky.
No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
Even with what I pay you you could get a better bag.
What?
They're here.
Absolutely not.
Not if it can't dig.
It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
You rented an automated litter box.
Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.
We'll be broke in four weeks.
How was your trip? Profitable?
Alan don't be afraid to evolve.
A well-accepted theory.
When I met you I thought that one day millions of years ago all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.
Goodbye Alan.
Okay. Goodbye Ellie.
Let me know if I can help Alan. Youre bad about asking for help but please ask me. Anything anytime.
I'd better get going.
The last of my breed.
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
It was never easy but before Jurassic Park you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
Good luck with the fund raising.
To a degree we never imagined.
You think they could talk to each other?
We've done cranial scans and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
I try not to.
You remember the sounds they made?
My favorite.
Raptors mostly.
Anything good?
Really?  What do you do there?
So Mark's working at the State Department now.
Sorry Alan it's been six years.
He used to know me.
He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
Hmm?
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
No we're not.
We're safe!
Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a minute would you?  They look worried.
No. I couldn't see.
Eric do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
You're right.
You should.
It's strikes me now I never told her that.
She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
The lady you called how do you know she can help us?
Something must've scared them.
Bonitas.
Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.
But then you never get to go in space.
See I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully everything you really need to learn you can learn it from the ground.
I want to be an astronaut.
I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.
No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
Do you have any kids?
Then we go home?
We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.
Closer you get to the water the bigger things get.
Why?
Are you sure?
We need to head for the coast.
I stayed pretty close to the compound Figured if anyone came to look for me that's where they'd start.
How much of this island have you explored?
Mine's new.
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
Know what this is?
I dunno. I mean it was kind of preachy. Chaos-this chaos-that. And like to me the guy seemed kind of high on himself.
What did you think?
Yeah.
Did you read Malcolm's book?
The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
Found this but the battery's dead.
Any weapons radios?
When InGen cleared out they left a lot of stuff behind.
Back then they hadn't tried to eat me.
The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
Which one do you prefer?
You're Alan Grant aren't you?  I read both of your books.
You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
They'll never make it. I mean they can't manage when the cable goes out.
On the island.
In Costa Rica?
Eric your parents are both here.
Stan.
Well we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
Whatever you do don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing.
It's no use Dr. Grant. No use.
Billy!
Back out! Move!
Amanda!
But you never came across just one.
Well that's good.
There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid Oklahoma. The "plus" is for bathroom fixtures fireplaces accessories patio furniture. Stuff like that.
There is no Kirby Enterprises is there?
You can stick with us or you can go and look for him. Either way you're probably not getting out of here alive.
Dr. Grant we're not leaving without our son.
No I'm sorry but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left something to get us off this island.
Sure you have. You wrote that book...
I have never been on this island!
We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.
Mr. Kirby trust me on this island there is no such thing as safe. We have to get back in this plane...
Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
What the hell is going on? What are they doing?
This plane can not land!
Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case the Costa Rican government.
That's hard to believe.
I'm flattered but I've taken this little adventure tour. And with the air restrictions they've imposed after the incident in San Diego you cant fly low enough to see anything of interest.
No no see Dr. Grant you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
That's a very nice offer Mr. Kirby but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified...
Now for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special something...
Hmmm.
I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
You know I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
Well sir I am a great admirer of yours and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
What can I do for you Mr. Kirby?
That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
Seal the cave?
No sir I haven't forgotten.
Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden and chained him to a tree and the children made sport of him.'
A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.
To begin with your methods of dating the past are crude to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
I apologize.
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
Indeed the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
We've never meant to be treasonable sir.  But up there in the face of that Cliff is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction you'll hang for high treason.
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
How did you know we'd come here?
Yes sir so it was -- thanks to you. But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written ...
He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was promptly revoked.
Certainly sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.
You know Dr. Maximus our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
Oh. no. sir. I was just assembling my notes.
Did you forget our appointment Cornelius?
Dr. Zaius --
Certainly sir. I'll get my notes and come right over.
Cornelius if you have a moment today I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
Good luck then.
They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science your language whatever knowledge you have.
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
Reconstructing a life. Care to have a look?
What are you doing there?
Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far his position's as good as yours.
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
Taylor I'd rather you -
Shut up.
Taylor you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
If there's any shooting Dr. Zaius you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.
Right now if you like.
When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.
You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.
It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
Where does the river lead?
I know ... Nevertheless I thank you for saving us. You'll be in trouble for going there.
Sorry Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water no vegetation. Nothing.
Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What would we find?
You still don't believe me do you?
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
As you wish.
Just the same I want one.
The best. But we won't need them.
Do you have any weapons?
Well Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
Right.  Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon.
We'd better get started. If the mounted police pick up our trail they'll come this far at least.
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
How did it go?
Zira....
A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
Zira listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
Oh Cornelius show some strength!
No thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
Well maybe they're not.
Because if he is a missing link it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
'I am not a missing link.'
How can scientific truth be heresy? What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? A mutation. A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape -
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
You didn't think so then.
The evidence was very meager --
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
It's probably wrong --
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
No they won't -
Don't be foolish. If it's true they'll have to accept it.
Zira are you trying to get my head cut off?
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
I don't. And I'm not going to try.
'Then how do you account for me?
No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.
Cornelius why do you insist on provoking him?
And even if it weren't why fly? Where would it get you?
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
And they fell out of the sky with you?
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
Oh Cornelius be quiet.
Now just a minute --
Where did you learn to do this?
Dear you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
Zira come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
The blood transfusion.
Remembers what?
Look -- she remembers.
Watch.  Hello Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
What's so special about him?
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
Neither do I.
No.
Do you have to work tonight?
Blessed are the vegetarians.
Well at least they haven't tried to bite us.
Let's find them all.
Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.
You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
Taylor -- quit riding him.
None at all.
Any particular reason?
That way.
Which direction?
Okay. If there's no life here we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
No.
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.
Good question.  Landon -- check your communications kit.
But how long is a day?
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
Yo!
Geiger counter?
Yo!
Got your sensors?
They're still dirty. And their bite is septic. Look at that ...
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
Hmph.
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
What do you mean made it? I'm an animal psychologist that's all. We don't have any authority.
But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
These animals are dirty doctor. They stink and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
This place is dirty doctor.
I don't know. This beast lost a lot of blood.
Will he live?
Him.
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
Yes sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
Sustained.
Objection!
Sustained.  Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.
Very well. I suggest we go and look at them.
That's true Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater.
Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
Directly Mr. President. This wretched man the accused is only a pawn in the conspiracy. We know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture. The State charges that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen experimented on this wounded animal tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster ...
Come to the point Dr. Honorius.
There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle and made him the lord of the planet.
State your case Mr. Prosecutor.
Well Dr. Zira? This is a man is he not?
Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore he has no rights under ape law.
Show this to the President.
Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us Bright Eyes why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
Some apes it seems are more equal than others.
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
I admit I know nothing of your culture.
Tell the court Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
Do as I say.
He's vicious Doctor. Besides it's against the rules.
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
I'll see.
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
What happened?
Well you know what they say. Human see human do.
He's trying to form words.
Huh?
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
Awww it still hurts doesn't it?
Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
You could get hurt doing that Doctor.
No change. The minute you open the door he goes into his act.
Good morning Julius. How's our patient today?
Good morning Dr. Zira.
You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here in six months we'll be running this planet.
We got off at the wrong stop.
Try telling them our names.
No cigar.
Okay.
Can we take a dip?
Let's take a look.
Scarecrows?
I'd like to know why not. You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people. So what did you do? You ran away.
But I'm not prepared to die.
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
Don't bother
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
Oh and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever.  Well you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted kid. How does it taste?
And the glory don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
Climb off me will you!
Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
I'm prepared to die.
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight or you might as well be dead.
All right --
What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
If only we could get a fix.
It's a fact Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better.
Prove it. If we can't get back it's still just a theory.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
long pause) You know it.
Apart from that you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it huh?
By our time.  You've turned gray.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
You don't seem very cut up about it.
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
Landon! Join the expedition.
We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.
Well? Where are we? Have any notion skipper?
We're here to stay.
Gone.
Forget it. Abandon ship.
It's no use ... there she goes.
To Earth! That we've landed!
What signal?
Landon! Send a last signal.
The flags of discontent. It's the only way anything ever gets changed.  Don't try to follow us.  I'm pretty handy with things like this.
What?
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
I think you're making a mistake.
Lucius.
I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose.
They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
Yes I can do that.
I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
What is it?
All right all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --
Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel Lucius?
Relax. You'll see it all later.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
Sorry Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
I'm for that.
Shouldn't we be moving on?
Fine. Just let her out.
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
I want her.
Zira doesn't want your female.
She comes along too.
Come on. Get me out of here.
So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
Who are you?
To scare off humans?
The Hunt Club.
Who put them up?
Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
Gorilla hunters ...
All right...  Get in...hurry.  Put this on.
He wouldn't leave her.
I told you not to bring the other one.
At the very least this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast and determine what's to be done with him.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
We're -- conducting a new experiment.
Why special?
Yes Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
I know it's a man. And you know the rules. No animals outside the compound and most certainly not without a leash.
A man Dr. Maximus.
What is that?
Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And you want to do the same to me!
Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
One is in a museum!
Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
My name is Taylor.
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
Sustain all objections but face the truth!
Sustained.
Let us assume as common sense dictates that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet then surely he sprang from our own. Yes sprang.  As an animal psychologist I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
How so?
Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
This is a joke in very poor taste.
Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal while the apes remained..."
Read it yourself.
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense he asks that this statement be read into the record.
Did we create his mind too? Not only can this man speak. He can write. He can reason.
Mind your tongue madame.
ThatŐs a lie!
Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
Sustained. In all fairness Dr. Zira you must admit the accused is a nonape and therefore has no rights under ape law.
By your leave Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed Dr. Honorius.
Don't look for it Taylor. You may not like what you find.
We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it ages ago.
What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
Why? From the first I've terrified you Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
No thanks. I'll take freedom.
Where else but in a cage does man belong?
Of course you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
Then there is another jungle?
He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet I'd say that was a fair bet.
Then answer this: If ran was superior why didn't he survive?
Cease fire! Withdraw!
Tell him to pull back!
That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture not proof.
I don't say he was a man like an Earthman but I'd call him a close relative for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet fragile as he was he came before you -- and was superior to you.
Okay.Up to the cave.
Of course.
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
Twelve hundred years ago.
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
What is your proposal?
All right let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
Stop right there.
You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I do know who you are Taylor. As I know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone.  You have just six hours to make a full confession. After that I'll employ surgery to obtain one.  Guards!
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
If you are protecting others of your kind it will cost you your identity.
I don't know.
You may well call it upside down since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest Taylor? Where are your women?
Then you admit --
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
All right suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
Of course.
That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy doctor.
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
A fort! Unconsciously you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
What about it?
Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
My tribe as you call it lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
You lied. Where is your tribe?
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
However it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from and no veterinary will touch you.
Emasculation to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately a kind of living death.
No.
Oh your case was preordained. In a way you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
What about me?
Identify him then. Speak to him.
With one of them.
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
God bless you.
Go with God Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
All right but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
Dr. Zira I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
It's better than going to prison for heresy.
We can't.
Would you like to come along?
Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
It's humiliating.
Why not?
Taylor please -- don't treat him that way.
Taylor you can't.
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
Taylor! Tell him.
Except that he's also the Chief Defender of the Faith.
Taylor please --
And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
What's the diagnosis doctor? A touch of the sun?
You threw us together remember? And you guessed right. Men like apes get despondent without a mate.
You want her that much?
Maybe not.
Actually you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
Yes.
Are you going to take her with you?
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
Listen-
You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
No I swear -- I never saw this man before.
You! ... You knew about this?
Second from the left.
Which one?
It's him...Landon.
A hearing.
What is this?
Shhhh!
Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?
Dr. Zaius I could have sworn he was answering you!
I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
There! Can you believe it? I looks like he's talking.
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
Listen listen -- I can speak --
Well Bright Eyes is our throat feeling better?
In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.
But the proof? The doll?
He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes some jungle beast will devour you.
But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
What?
But there's the doll sir.
Secondly if these 'tools' as you call them are unidentified why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
Let them talk Mr President. Let them talk.
Mr. President I believe the Prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes.
He doesn't know.
How sad. Stuffed and mounted eh? Dead men like sunken ships can tell no stories. And his other companion?
Where are they now?
This is his assertion.
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
Like you I find it difficult.
Do you believe him?
I do not state it sir. The prisoner does.
Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
Yes Sir.
Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
But perhaps he understood --
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
He's moving his fingers!
Please.
What?!
The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.
I would like to use the bathroom --
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
Why?  What's the problem?
Laurie I'll have to ask you to come with me.
Major Adamson I can't seem to get in the door.
The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
We don't really know sir but bluntly our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
As you can see we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
What kind of time frame are we talking about?
Well sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
What about our end?
They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.
Washington?
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
Small army from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
No idea who's behind this?
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
Had a lot of blood in him.
Saw the world that night -- random empty hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
That man then he was the first.  The first you --
We don't know that.
God isn't there to do it.
Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
Why doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
Who is she?  Do you know her?
A whore fucking.
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
Wrong answers?
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
Don't call me that.
Walter --
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING VEIDT?
You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
What's your theory?
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
The bearer of bad news.
Hello Adrian.
Hi Jon.
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
Jon -- for Godšs sake what do you see?
Space and time.  I finally understand Laurie.  I see it all now.
Jon --
Veidtšs complex.
Jon where are we?
The south pole.  Timešs flowing backwards.
Jon -- what??
Itšs very strange.  Timešs flowing backwards . . .
Cured yes.
What -- am I --
Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
I won't do that.
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
You're the only human being I care for.
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
Jon I do not want to hear it.
Please Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
Because you can't I know it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
Because --
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
But you knew that I'd -- die.
I didn't give you cancer Laurie.  Not you not the others.  I don't know what did.
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
Yes I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
That's how time works Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
Well I just you just said -- don't act surprised.
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
Jon does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
You -- you know about me and Dan?
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds for example you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
Jesus Jon I nearly choked to -- where are we --
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
It will happen Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us can do anything to change it.
Jon no -- I can't --
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
Collect me?
I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
. . . And just how would you manage that?
I could stay and go.
Mm hmm.
Would you like me to stay?
Not yet there's plenty of time.
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
I'm here Laurie.
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
Blake?  Dead?
We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
Your problem Dan is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers and drug dealers and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
Then Išve been a very bad boy and youšll have to spank me.  Christ!  Išm doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
What if youšre wrong??
Išm not.
And what if youšre wrong?
Donšt be obtuse Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past none of this will happen.  We wonšt even be here will we?
I've seen them!  I've seen them in there. 
Adrian -- you've lost it.
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds Daniel other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
What is it?  How does it work?
Gentlemen the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.
Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
What??
Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.
The missing scientists.
Yeah.  See I've been working on a little project.  Top secret of course . . .
Thanks for the offer Adrian.  I'll let you know.
Good.  Be careful Daniel don't let up your guard.  Look I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
She's with me.
I don't know but . . . in the wake of all that's happened I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
Who?
Good night.
You did the right thing Daniel.  Let's stay in touch okay?  Good night.
No.  I just wanted you to --
If he comes here I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
I know I know it's just -- he's back on the street he smells blood.
Us.  You mean the Watchmen.
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know stalking us.
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason won't they -- ?
Wherever we are it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
Dan -- what do we do now?
Everything's changed --
Those cars.  What year is this??
Dan is this -- is this New York??
Where did he go?
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
What was he doing?
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
Welcome back Night Owl.
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
My God!  We bust him out of jail in the middle of a riot and he stops to take a --
I think he's going to the john.
What's he doing?
. . . What??
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's about to end.  I feel like I could save it.
That's because --
No offense Laurie but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
Yes you are.
No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.
The costumes.  Am I right?
What?
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
They're practically on us . . .
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
All right.  Mission accomplished.
They're following us.
Oh Laurie.  Jesus.  No.
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
What the hell -- ?
Okay!
This'd better not be what I think it is.
Don't look.  Turn around.
What are you up to?
God you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is I try to remember why we did it and I can't.  Helping people or righting wrongs or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract.
Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.
You and me.
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
Antarctica??
I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
Memory lane.
Enough is enough Daniel.  Where exactly are we?
With any luck the world'll end before we get ours.
I'm an open target Dan.  If you're with me --
Laurie --
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
-- What is it.
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
Eight cops?  Oh great.  A jury's gonna love that.
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
. . . What?
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here you pick one.
Old?
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you Daniel you look . . .
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
Sure.  It works.  I mean look at this face Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
Play one.  Educate yourself.
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?
His . . . whatever.
His what?
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight okay?
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean if you need some aspirin or --
You're sure?
No screw that.  What you were saying before it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
Laurie wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel thanks but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --
Dan what are you so scared of?  I mean me I've spent all these years keeping Jon together and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad.  I'm finally free to to go out and live my own life and --
Maybe not but why take chances?
They're not following me Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me seeing each other someone might put two and two together . . .
Oh yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
Christ yes I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights I'll tell you . . .  How about you Laurie?
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
Well that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
Of course we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
Damn straight!  We were heroes.
Damn straight.

Okay okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.
Fine but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
Dan are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Sorry it's this thing with Blake.  I mean you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Adrian.  Itšs too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake and --
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
What caused it?
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
What happened?
Okay let's just . . . thank you.
Sorry Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
SHUT UP Rorschach.
Coward.  Giving up.
Cases leads -- they don't matter Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us it doesn't matter.
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
We're running Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.
I don't think she's coming with us.
Where's Laurie?
Come on Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
What do you mean frame-up?
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
What new information?
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
. . . That was quick.
Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind use the back stairs all right?
Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge.  Thought you might want to spread the word.
Rorschach that was a long time ago.  I mean that -- that's just paranoia.
So do I.  So do you.
Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
Hiya pardner.  Long time no see.
My dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better than ever.
-- What?
I can fix it.
Janey will you marry me?
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
We should get back to the lab.  You okay Jon?
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
We should get back --  What?
Anything for science I guess.  Janey there's something --
Jon Osterman you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
Nothing wrong with ketchup.
With lots of ketchup?
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
Isn't it true that you --
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
Did you know he was back on the streets?
No comment.
No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --
Oh sweetheart just a quick one.
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
Thanks no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?
That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.
Jon??  You mean he's --
Oh I am honey.  You see Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us every living soul in deep deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
I don't know why you've been keeping me here but you're in deep shit --
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Am I free to go?
All right Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
That's it.  This is all a trick isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
What does this mean?  What does it --
I'm terribly sorry.
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
Sit down Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
Then why don't you ask him?!?
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
I don't know their real names!
You're lying Miss Juspeczyk.
I don't know their real names.
Their real names please.
I'm sorry about Blake.
Maybe I'll do that.
Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
I suppose I'm serving my purpose aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
What about you?
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy he's content he's doing his work --
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
Stay Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
He's a little farther gone every time.
Please.
I'll take a raincheck Laurie.
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
Don't rub it in.  I live here.
Laurie!  Good to see you.
Adrian.
No no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case Rorschach I got something for you.
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Rorschach you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
You're making a big --
Edgar William Jacobi aka William Edgar Bright a.k.a. Moloch.
I don't know who you are buddy but I swear to God you got the wrong guy.
Before you do that you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
Call off the cat and I'll kill you Veidt.
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
Dr. Manhattan right.  Now if you boys care to join me we'll go save the world.
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
Fate of the world at stake Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad press.
Yeah I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .
What is that ungodly smell?
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
Ever see one of these before?
New information.
