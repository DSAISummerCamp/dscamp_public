One American's Story
Cultures Clash on
the Prairie
The cattle industry boomed in
the late 1800s, as the
culture of the Plains Indians
declined.
Today, ranchers and Plains
Indians work to preserve their
cultural traditions.
WHY IT MATTERS NOW
Zitkala-Sˇa was born a Sioux in 1876. As she grew up on the Great Plains, she
learned the ways of her people. When Zitkala-Sˇa was eight years old she was sent
to a Quaker school in Indiana. Though her mother warned her of the “white
men’s lies,” Zitkala-Sˇa was not prepared for the loss of dignity and identity she
experienced, which was symbolized by the cutting of her hair.
A PERSONAL VOICE ZITKALA-SˇA
“ I cried aloud . . . and heard them gnaw off one of my thick braids. Then I lost my
spirit. Since the day I was taken from my mother I had suffered extreme indignities. . . . And now my long hair was shingled like a coward’s! In my anguish I
moaned for my mother, but no one came. . . . Now I was only one of many little
animals driven by a herder.”
—The School Days of an Indian Girl
Zitkala-Sˇa experienced firsthand the clash of two very different
cultures that occurred as ever-growing numbers of white settlers
moved onto the Great Plains. In the resulting struggle, the Native
American way of life was changed forever.
The Culture of the Plains Indians
Zitkala-Sˇa knew very little about the world east of the Mississippi
River. Most Easterners knew equally little about the West, picturing a
vast desert occupied by savage tribes. That view could not have been
more inaccurate. In fact, distinctive and highly developed Native American ways
of life existed on the Great Plains, the grassland extending through the westcentral portion of the United States. (See map on page 411.)

To the east, near the lower Missouri
River, tribes such as the Osage and Iowa had,
for more than a century, hunted and planted crops and settled in small villages. Farther
west, nomadic tribes such as the Sioux and
Cheyenne gathered wild foods and hunted
buffalo. Peoples of the Plains, abiding by
tribal law, traded and produced beautifully
crafted tools and clothing.
THE HORSE AND THE BUFFALO After
the Spanish brought horses to New Mexico
in 1598, the Native American way of life
began to change. As the native peoples
acquired horses—and then guns—they were
able to travel farther and hunt more efficiently. By the mid-1700s, almost all the
tribes on the Great Plains had left their
farms to roam the plains and hunt buffalo.
Their increased mobility often led to war when hunters in one tribe trespassed on other tribes’ hunting grounds. For the young men of a tribe, taking part
in war parties and raids was a way to win prestige. But a Plains warrior gained
more honor by “counting coup” than by killing enemies. This practice involved
touching a live enemy with a coup stick and escaping unharmed. And sometimes
warring tribes would call a truce so that they could trade goods, share news, or
enjoy harvest festivals. Native Americans made tepees from buffalo hides and also
used the skins for clothing, shoes, and blankets. Buffalo meat was dried into jerky
or mixed with berries and fat to make a staple food called pemmican. While the
horse gave Native Americans speed and mobility, the buffalo provided many of
their basic needs and was central to life on the Plains. (See chart on page 413.)
FAMILY LIFE Native Americans on the plains usually lived in small extended
family groups with ties to other bands that spoke the same language. Young men
trained to become hunters and warriors. The women helped butcher the game
and prepared the hides that the men brought back to the camp; young women
sometimes chose their own husbands.
The Plains Indian tribes believed that powerful spirits controlled events in
the natural world. Men or women who showed particular sensitivity to the
spirits became medicine men or women, or shamans. Children learned
proper behavior and culture through stories and myths, games, and good
examples. Despite their communal way of life, however, no individual was
allowed to dominate the group. The leaders of a tribe ruled by counsel
rather than by force, and land was held in common for the use of the
whole tribe.
Settlers Push Westward
The culture of the white settlers differed in many ways from that of the
Native Americans on the plains. Unlike Native Americans, who believed
that land could not be owned, the settlers believed that owning land, making a mining claim, or starting a business would give them a stake in the
country. They argued that the Native Americans had forfeited their rights
to the land because they hadn’t settled down to “improve” it. Concluding
that the plains were “unsettled,” migrants streamed westward along railroad
and wagon trails to claim the land.

410 CHAPTER 13
THE LURE OF SILVER AND GOLD The prospect of striking it rich was one powerful attraction of the West. The discovery of gold in Colorado in 1858 drew tens
of thousands of miners to the region.
Most mining camps and tiny frontier towns had filthy, ramshackle living
quarters. Rows of tents and shacks with dirt “streets” and wooden sidewalks had
replaced unspoiled picturesque landscapes. Fortune seekers of every description
—including Irish, German, Polish, Chinese, and African-American men—crowded the camps and boomtowns. A few hardy, business-minded women tried their
luck too, working as laundresses, freight haulers, or miners. Cities such as Virginia
City, Nevada, and Helena, Montana, originated as mining camps on Native
American land.
The Government Restricts Native Americans
While allowing more settlers to move westward, the arrival of the railroads also
influenced the government’s policy toward the Native Americans who lived on
the plains. In 1834, the federal government had passed an
act that designated the entire Great Plains as one enormous
reservation, or land set aside for Native American tribes. In
the 1850s, however, the government changed its policy and
created treaties that defined specific boundaries for each
tribe. Most Native Americans spurned the government
treaties and continued to hunt on their traditional lands,
clashing with settlers and miners—with tragic results.
MASSACRE AT SAND CREEK One of the most tragic
events occurred in 1864. Most of the Cheyenne, assuming
they were under the protection of the U.S. government, had
peacefully returned to Colorado’s Sand Creek Reserve for
the winter. Yet General S. R. Curtis, U.S. Army commander
in the West, sent a telegram to militia colonel John
Chivington that read, “I want no peace till the Indians suffer more.” In response, Chivington and his troops descended on the Cheyenne and Arapaho—about 200 warriors and
500 women and children—camped at Sand Creek. The
attack at dawn on November 29, 1864 killed over 150
inhabitants, mostly women and children.
DEATH ON THE BOZEMAN TRAIL The Bozeman Trail
ran directly through Sioux hunting grounds in the Bighorn
Mountains. The Sioux chief, Red Cloud (Mahpiua Luta),
had unsuccessfully appealed to the government to end
white settlement on the trail. In December 1866, the warrior Crazy Horse ambushed Captain William J. Fetterman
and his company at Lodge Trail Ridge. Over 80 soldiers were
killed. Native Americans called this fight the Battle of the
Hundred Slain. Whites called it the Fetterman Massacre.
Skirmishes continued until the government agreed to
close the Bozeman Trail. In return, the Treaty of Fort
Laramie, in which the Sioux agreed to live on a
reservation along the Missouri River, was forced on the
leaders of the Sioux in 1868. Sitting Bull (Tatanka
Iyotanka), leader of the Hunkpapa Sioux, had never signed it.
Although the Ogala and Brule Sioux did sign the treaty, they
expected to continue using their traditional hunting grounds.

KEY PLAYER
SITTING BULL
1831–1890
As a child, Sitting Bull was known
as Hunkesni, or Slow; he earned
the name Tatanka Iyotanka
(Sitting Bull) after a fight with the
Crow, a traditional enemy of the
Sioux.
Sitting Bull led his people by
the strength of his character and
purpose. He was a warrior, spiritual leader, and medicine man,
and he was determined that
whites should leave Sioux territory. His most famous fight was
at the Little Bighorn River. About
his opponent, George Armstrong
Custer, he said, “They tell me I
murdered Custer. It is a lie. . . .
He was a fool and rode to his
death.”
After Sitting Bull’s surrender to
the federal government in 1881,
his dislike of whites did not
change. He was killed by Native
American police at Standing Rock
Reservation in December 1890.

Bloody Battles Continue
The Treaty of Fort Laramie provided only a temporary halt to warfare.
The conflict between the two cultures continued as settlers moved westward and Native American nations resisted the restrictions imposed upon
them. A Sioux warrior explained why.
A PERSONAL VOICE GALL, A HUNKPAPA SIOUX
“ [We] have been taught to hunt and live on the game. You tell us
that we must learn to farm, live in one house, and take on your
ways. Suppose the people living beyond the great sea should come
and tell you that you must stop farming, and kill your cattle, and take
your houses and lands, what would you do? Would you not fight them?”
—quoted in Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee
RED RIVER WAR In late 1868, war broke out yet again as the Kiowa and
Comanche engaged in six years of raiding that finally led to the Red River War
of 1874–1875. The U.S. Army responded by herding the people of friendly tribes
onto reservations while opening fire on all others. General Philip Sheridan, a
Union Army veteran, gave orders “to destroy their villages and ponies, to kill
and hang all warriors, and to bring back all women and children.” With such
tactics, the army crushed resistance on the southern plains.
GOLD RUSH Within four years of the Treaty of Fort Laramie, miners began
searching the Black Hills for gold. The Sioux, Cheyenne, and Arapaho protested
to no avail. In 1874, when Colonel George A. Custer reported that the
Black Hills had gold “from the grass roots down,” a gold rush was on.
Red Cloud and Spotted Tail, another Sioux chief, vainly appealed
again to government officials in Washington.
CUSTER’S LAST STAND In early June 1876, the Sioux and
Cheyenne held a sun dance, during which Sitting Bull had a
vision of soldiers and some Native Americans falling from their
horses. When Colonel Custer and his troops reached the Little
Bighorn River, the Native Americans were ready for them.
Led by Crazy Horse, Gall, and Sitting Bull, the warriors—
with raised spears and rifles—outflanked and crushed Custer’s
troops. Within an hour, Custer and all of the men of the
Seventh Cavalry were dead. By late 1876, however, the Sioux
were beaten. Sitting Bull and a few followers took refuge in
Canada, where they remained until 1881. Eventually, to prevent his
people’s starvation, Sitting Bull was forced to surrender. Later, in 1885,
he appeared in William F. “Buffalo Bill” Cody’s Wild West Show.
The Government Supports Assimilation
The Native Americans still had supporters in the United States, and debate over
the treatment of Native Americans continued. The well-known writer Helen Hunt
Jackson, for example, exposed the government’s many broken promises in her
1881 book A Century of Dishonor. At the same time many sympathizers supported
assimilation, a plan under which Native Americans would give up their beliefs
and way of life and become part of the white culture.
THE DAWES ACT In 1887, Congress passed the Dawes Act aiming to
“Americanize” the Native Americans. The act broke up the reservations and gave
some of the reservation land to individual Native Americans—160 acres to each

sell the remainder of the reservations to settlers, and the resulting income would
be used by Native Americans to buy farm implements. By 1932, whites had taken
about two-thirds of the territory that had been set aside for Native Americans. In
the end, the Native Americans received no money from the sale of these lands.
THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BUFFALO Perhaps the most significant blow to
tribal life on the plains was the destruction of the buffalo. Tourists and fur traders
shot buffalo for sport. U.S. General Sheridan noted with approval that buffalo
hunters were destroying the Plains Indians’ main source of food, clothing, shelter, and fuel. In 1800, approximately 65 million buffalo roamed the plains; by
1890, fewer than 1000 remained. In 1900, the United States sheltered, in
Yellowstone National Park, a single wild herd of buffalo.
The Battle of Wounded Knee
The Sioux continued to suffer poverty and disease. In desperation, they turned to
a Paiute prophet who promised that if the Sioux performed a ritual called the
Ghost Dance, Native American lands and way of life would be restored.
The Ghost Dance movement spread rapidly among the 25,000 Sioux on the
Dakota reservation. Alarmed military leaders ordered the arrest of Sitting Bull. In
December 1890, about 40 Native American police were sent to arrest him. Sitting
Bull’s friend and bodyguard, Catch-the-Bear, shot one of them. The police then
killed Sitting Bull. In the aftermath, Chief Big Foot led the fearful Sioux away.
WOUNDED KNEE On December 28, 1890, the Seventh Cavalry—Custer’s old
regiment—rounded up about 350 starving and freezing Sioux and took them to a
camp at Wounded Knee Creek in South Dakota. The next day, the soldiers
demanded that the Native Americans give up all their weapons. A shot was fired;
from which side, it was not clear. The soldiers opened fire with deadly cannon.

Within minutes, the Seventh Cavalry slaughtered 300
unarmed Native Americans, including several children. The
soldiers left the corpses to freeze on the ground. This event,
the Battle of Wounded Knee, brought the Indian wars—
and an entire era—to a bitter end.
A PERSONAL VOICE BLACK ELK
“I did not know then how much was ended. When I look
back . . . I can still see the butchered women and children
lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch. . . .
And I can see that something else died there in the bloody
mud, and was buried in the blizzard. A people’s dream died
there. It was a beautiful dream.”
—Black Elk Speaks
Cattle Becomes Big Business
As the great herds of buffalo disappeared, and Native
Americans were forced onto smaller and less desirable reserverations, horses and cattle flourished on the plains. As cattle
ranchers opened up the Great Plains to big business, ranching
from Texas to Kansas became a profitable investment.
VAQUEROS AND COWBOYS American settlers had never
managed large herds on the open range, and they learned
from their Mexican neighbors how to round up, rope,
brand, and care for the animals. The animals themselves,
the Texas longhorns, were sturdy, short-tempered breeds
accustomed to the dry grasslands of southern Spain.
Spanish settlers raised longhorns for food and brought
horses to use as work animals and for transportation.
As American as the cowboy seems today, his way of life stemmed directly
from that of those first Spanish ranchers in Mexico. The cowboy’s clothes, food,
and vocabulary were heavily influenced by the Mexican vaquero, who was the first
to wear spurs, which he attached with straps to his bare feet and used to control
his horse. His chaparreras, or leather overalls, became known as chaps. He ate
charqui, or “jerky”—dried strips of meat. The Spanish bronco caballo, or “rough
horse” that ran wild, became known as a bronco or bronc. The strays, or mesteños,
were the same mustangs that the American cowboy tamed and prized. The
Mexican rancho became the American ranch. Finally, the English words corral and

rodeo were borrowed from Spanish. In his skills, dress, and speech, the Mexican
vaquero was the true forerunner of the American “buckaroo” or cowboy.
Despite the plentiful herds of Western cattle, cowboys were not in great
demand until the railroads reached the Great Plains. Before the Civil War, ranchers for the most part didn’t stray far from their homesteads with their cattle. There
were, of course, some exceptions. During the California gold rush in 1849, some
hardy cattlemen on horseback braved a long trek, or drive, through Apache territory and across the desert to collect $25 to $125 a head for their cattle. In 1854,
two ranchers drove their cattle 700 miles to Muncie, Indiana, where they put
them on stock cars bound for New York City. When the cattle were unloaded in
New York, the stampede that followed caused a panic on Third Avenue. Parts of
the country were not ready for the mass transportation of animals.
GROWING DEMAND FOR BEEF After the Civil War, the demand for beef skyrocketed, partly due to the rapidly growing cities. The Chicago Union Stock Yards
opened in 1865, and by spring 1866, the railroads were running regularly through
Sedalia, Missouri. From Sedalia, Texas ranchers could ship their cattle to Chicago
and markets throughout the East. They found, however, that the route to Sedalia
presented several obstacles: including thunderstorms and rain-swollen rivers. Also,
in 1866, farmers angry about trampled crops blockaded cattle in Baxter Springs,
Kansas, preventing them from reaching Sedalia. Some herds then had to be sold at
cut-rate prices, others died of starvation.
THE COW TOWN The next year, cattlemen found a more convenient route.
Illinois cattle dealer Joseph McCoy approached several Western towns with plans
to create a shipping yard where the trails and rail lines came together. The tiny
Kansas town of Abilene enthusiastically agreed to the plan. McCoy built cattle
pens, a three-story hotel, and helped survey the Chisholm Trail—the major cattle route from San Antonio, Texas, through Oklahoma to Kansas. Thirty-five
thousand head of cattle were shipped out of the yard in Abilene during its first

year in operation. The following year, business more than doubled, to 75,000
head. Soon ranchers were hiring cowboys to drive their cattle to Abilene. Within
a few years, the Chisholm Trail had worn wide and deep.
A Day in the Life of a Cowboy
The meeting of the Chisholm Trail and the railroad in Abilene ushered in the heyday of the cowboy. As many as 55,000 worked the plains between 1866 and 1885.
Although folklore and postcards depicted the cowboy as Anglo-American, about
25 percent of them were African American, and at least 12 percent were Mexican.
The romanticized American cowboy of myth rode the open range, herding cattle
and fighting villains. Meanwhile, the real-life cowboy was doing nonstop work.
A DAY’S WORK A cowboy worked 10 to 14 hours a day on a ranch and 14 or
more on the trail, alert at all times for dangers that might harm or upset the herds.
Some cowboys were as young as 15; most were broken-down by the time they
were 40. A cowboy might own his saddle, but his trail horse usually belonged to
his boss. He was an expert rider and roper. His gun might be used to protect the
herd from wild or diseased animals rather than to hurt or chase outlaws.
ROUNDUP The cowboy’s season began with a spring roundup, in which he and
other hands from the ranch herded all the longhorns they could find on the open
range into a large corral. They kept the herd penned there for several days, until
the cattle were so hungry that they preferred grazing to running away. Then the
cowboys sorted through the herd, claiming the cattle that were marked with the
brand of their ranch and calves that still needed to be branded. After the herd was
gathered and branded, the trail boss chose a crew for the long drive.
THE LONG DRIVE This overland transport, or long drive, of the animals often
lasted about three months. A typical drive included one cowboy for every 250 to
300 head of cattle; a cook who also drove the chuck wagon and set up camp; and a
wrangler who cared for the extra horses. A trail boss earned $100 or more a month
for supervising the drive and negotiating with settlers and Native Americans.

During the long drive, the cowboy was in the saddle
from dawn to dusk. He slept on the ground and bathed in
rivers. He risked death and loss every day of the drive, especially at river crossings, where cattle often hesitated and
were swept away. Because lightning was a constant danger,
cowboys piled their spurs, buckles, and other metal objects
at the edge of their camp to avoid attracting lightning bolts.
Thunder, or even a sneeze, could cause a stampede.
LEGENDS OF THE WEST Legendary figures like James
Butler “Wild Bill” Hickok and Martha Jane Burke (Calamity
Jane) actually never dealt with cows. Hickok served as a
scout and a spy during the Civil War and, later, as a marshal
in Abilene, Kansas. He was a violent man who was shot and
killed while holding a pair of aces and a pair of eights in a
poker game, a hand still known as the “dead man’s hand.”
Calamity Jane was an expert sharpshooter who dressed as a
man. She may have been a scout for Colonel George Custer.
The End of the Open Range
Almost as quickly as cattle herds multiplied and ranching
became big business, the cattle frontier met its end.
Overgrazing of the land, extended bad weather, and the
invention of barbed wire were largely responsible.
Between 1883 and 1887 alternating patterns of dry summers and harsh winters wiped out whole herds. Most ranchers then turned to smaller herds of highgrade stock that would yield more meat per animal. Ranchers fenced the land
with barbed wire, invented by Illinois farmer Joseph F. Glidden. It was cheap and
easy to use and helped to turn the open plains into a series of fenced-in ranches.
The era of the wide-open West was over.

WHY IT MATTERS NOW
When Esther Clark Hill was a girl on the Kansas prairie in
the 1800s, her father often left the family to go on hunting or
trading expeditions. His trips left Esther’s mother, Allena
Clark, alone on the farm.
Esther remembered her mother holding on to the reins of
a runaway mule team, “her black hair tumbling out of its pins
and over her shoulders, her face set and white, while one small
girl clung with chattering teeth to the sides of the rocking
wagon.” The men in the settlement spoke admiringly about
“Leny’s nerve,” and Esther thought that daily life presented a
challenge even greater than driving a runaway team.
A PERSONAL VOICE ESTHER CLARK HILL
“ I think, as much courage as it took to hang onto the reins that day, it took more
to live twenty-four hours at a time, month in and out, on the lonely and lovely
prairie, without giving up to the loneliness.”
—quoted in Pioneer Women
As the railroads penetrated the frontier and the days of the free-ranging cowboy ended, hundreds of thousands of families migrated west, lured by vast tracts
of cheap, fertile land. In their effort to establish a new life, they endured extreme
hardships and loneliness.
Settlers Move Westward to Farm
It took over 250 years—from the first settlement at Jamestown until 1870—to
turn 400 million acres of forests and prairies into flourishing farms. Settling the
second 400 million acres took only 30 years, from 1870 to 1900. Federal land policy and the completion of transcontinental railroad lines made this rapid settlement possible.
RAILROADS OPEN THE WEST From 1850 to 1871, the federal government
made huge land grants to the railroads—170 million acres, worth half a billion

dollars—for laying track in the West. In one grant, both the Union Pacific and the
Central Pacific received 10 square miles of public land for every mile of track laid
in a state and 20 square miles of land for every mile of track laid in a territory.
In the 1860s, the two companies began a race to lay track. The Central Pacific
moved eastward from Sacramento, and the Union Pacific moved westward from
Omaha. Civil War veterans, Irish and Chinese immigrants, African Americans,
and Mexican Americans did most of the grueling labor. In late 1868, workers for
the Union Pacific cut their way through the solid rock of the mountains, laying
up to eight miles of track a day. Both companies had reached Utah by the spring
of 1869. Fifteen years later, the country boasted five transcontinental railroads.
The rails to the East and West Coasts were forever linked.
The railroad companies sold some of their land to farmers for two to ten dollars an acre. Some companies successfully sent agents to Europe to recruit buyers.
By 1880, 44 percent of the settlers in Nebraska and more than 70 percent of those
in Minnesota and Wisconsin were immigrants.
GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR SETTLEMENT Another powerful attraction of
the West was the land itself. In 1862, Congress passed the Homestead Act, offering 160 acres of land free to any citizen or intended citizen who was head of the
household. From 1862 to 1900, up to 600,000 families took advantage of the government’s offer. Several thousand settlers were exodusters—African Americans
who moved from the post-Reconstruction South to Kansas.
Despite the massive response by homesteaders, or settlers on this free land,
private speculators and railroad and state government agents sometimes used the
law for their own gain. Cattlemen fenced open lands, while miners and woodcutters claimed national resources. Only about 10 percent of the land was actually settled by the families for whom it was intended. In addition, not all plots of
land were of equal value. Although 160 acres could provide a decent living in the
fertile soil of Iowa or Minnesota, settlers on drier Western land
required larger plots to make farming worthwhile.
Eventually, the government strengthened the Homestead Act
and passed more legislation to encourage settlers. In 1889, a major
land giveaway in what is now Oklahoma attracted thousands of
people. In less than a day, land-hungry settlers claimed 2 million
acres in a massive land rush. Some took possession of the land
before the government officially declared it open. Because these settlers claimed land sooner than they were supposed to, Oklahoma
came to be known as the Sooner State.

THE CLOSING OF THE FRONTIER As settlers gobbled up Western land, Henry
D. Washburn and fellow explorer Nathaniel P. Langford asked Congress to help
protect the wilderness from settlement. In 1870, Washburn, who was surveying
land in northwestern Wyoming, described the area’s geysers and bubbling springs
as: “objects new in experience . . . possessing unlimited grandeur and beauty.”
In 1872, the government created Yellowstone National Park. Seven years later,
the Department of the Interior forced railroads to give up their claim to Western
landholdings that were equal in area to New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia combined. Even so, by 1880, individuals had
bought more than 19 million acres of government-owned land. Ten years later,
the Census Bureau declared that the country no longer had a continuous frontier
line—the frontier no longer existed. To many, the frontier was what had made
America unique. In an 1893 essay entitled “The Significance of the Frontier in
American History,” the historian Frederick Jackson Turner agreed.
A PERSONAL VOICE FREDERICK JACKSON TURNER
“ American social development has been continually beginning over again on the
frontier. This perennial rebirth, this fluidity of American life, this expansion westward with its new opportunities, its continuous touch with the simplicity of primitive society, furnish the forces dominating American character.”
—“The Significance of the Frontier in American History”
Today many historians question Turner’s view. They think he gave too much
importance to the frontier in the nation’s development and in shaping a special
American character.
Settlers Meet the Challenges of the Plains
The frontier settlers faced extreme hardships—droughts, floods, fires, blizzards,
locust plagues, and occasional raids by outlaws and Native Americans. Yet the
number of people living west of the Mississippi River grew from 1 percent of the
nation’s population in 1850 to almost 30 percent by the turn of the century.
DUGOUTS AND SODDIES Since trees were scarce, most settlers built their
homes from the land itself. Many pioneers dug their homes into the sides of
ravines or small hills. A stovepipe jutting from the ground was often the only
clear sign of such a dugout home.
Those who moved to the broad, flat plains often made freestanding houses by
stacking blocks of prairie turf. Like a dugout, a sod home, or soddy, was warm in

winter and cool in summer. Soddies were small, however, and offered little light
or air. They were havens for snakes, insects, and other pests. Although they were
fireproof, they leaked continuously when it rained.
WOMEN’S WORK Virtually alone on the flat, endless prairie, homesteaders had
to be almost superhumanly self-sufficient. Women often worked beside the men in
the fields, plowing the land and planting and harvesting the predominant crop,
wheat. They sheared the sheep and carded wool to make clothes for their families.
They hauled water from wells that they had helped to dig, and made soap and candles from tallow. At harvest time, they canned fruits and vegetables. They were
skilled in doctoring—from snakebites to crushed limbs. Women also sponsored
schools and churches in an effort to build strong communities.
TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR FARMERS Establishing a homestead was challenging. Once accomplished, it was farming the prairie, year in and year out, that
became an overwhelming task. In 1837, John Deere had invented a steel plow that
could slice through heavy soil. In 1847, Cyrus McCormick began to mass-produce
a reaping machine. But a mass market for these devices didn’t fully develop until
the late 1800s with the migration of farmers onto the plains.
Other new and improved devices made farm work speedier—the spring-tooth
harrow to prepare the soil (1869), the grain drill to plant the seed (1841), barbed
wire to fence the land (1874), and the corn binder (1878). Then came a reaper that
could cut and thresh wheat in one pass. By 1890, there were more than 900 manufacturers of farm equipment. In 1830, producing a bushel of grain took about 183
minutes. By 1900, with the use of these machines, it took only 10 minutes. These
inventions made more grain available for a wider market.
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION The federal government supported farmers by
financing agricultural education. The Morrill Act of 1862 and 1890 gave federal
land to the states to help finance agricultural colleges, and the Hatch Act of 1887
established agricultural experiment stations to inform farmers of new developments. Agricultural researchers developed grains for arid soil and techniques for
dry farming, which helped the land to retain moisture. These innovations enabled
the dry eastern plains to flourish and become “the breadbasket of the nation.”

FARMERS IN DEBT Elaborate machinery was expensive, and farmers often had
to borrow money to buy it. When prices for wheat were higher, farmers could
usually repay their loans. When wheat prices fell, however, farmers needed to raise
more crops to make ends meet. This situation gave rise to a new type of farming
in the late 1870s. Railroad companies and investors created bonanza farms,
enormous single-crop spreads of 15,000–50,000 acres. The Cass-CheneyDalrymple farm near Cassleton, North Dakota, for example, covered 24 square
miles. By 1900, the average farmer had nearly 150 acres under cultivation. Some
farmers mortgaged their land to buy more property, and as farms grew bigger, so
did farmers’ debts. Between 1885 and 1890, much of the plains experienced
drought, and the large single-crop operations couldn’t compete with smaller
farms, which could be more flexible in the crops they grew. The bonanza farms
slowly folded into bankruptcy.
Farmers also felt pressure from the rising cost of shipping grain. Railroads
charged Western farmers a higher fee than they did farmers in the East. Also, the
railroads sometimes charged more for short hauls, for which there was no competing transportation, than for long hauls. The railroads claimed that they were
merely doing business, but farmers resented being taken advantage of. “No other
system of taxation has borne as heavily on the people as those extortions and
inequalities of railroad charges” wrote Henry Demarest Lloyd in an article in the
March 1881 edition of Atlantic Monthly.
Many farmers found themselves growing as much grain as they could grow,
on as much land as they could acquire, which resulted in going further into debt.
But they were not defeated by these conditions. Instead, these challenging conditions drew farmers together in a common cause.
