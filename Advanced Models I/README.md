# Introduction to Neural Networks

This module introduces the basic concepts of artificial neural networks and the powerful software used to train them.  The material contains conceptual and simple mathematical foundations for neural networks, and examples and investigations using TensorFlow/Keras in the Python programming language.

# Outline

* Introduction artificial neural networks. Describes the historical, intuitive relationship between artificial neurons and neural networks with their biological counterparts.

* Neural Network Calculations.  Illustrates the simple calculations carried out by artificial neurons, and the complex patterns when simple neurons are linked.

* Feed Forward Neural Networks. Provides details on how feed forward neural networks are created and trained.

* TensorFlow/Keras. Introduces the popular Python package, and guides exploration into building and training neural network models in Python.


# Contents
