# Introduction to Linear Models and Neural Networks

This module introduces the basic concepts of modeling through linear  models and advances to artificial neural networks. The material contains conceptual and simple mathematical foundations for linear and logistic regression and neural networks, and examples and investigations using TensorFlow/Keras in the Python programming language.

# Outline

* Brief introduction to linear models - linear and logistic regression. Motivates modeling though simple examples as a prelude to advanced modeling using neural networks

* Introduction artificial neural networks. Describes the historical, intuitive relationship between artificial neurons and neural networks with their biological counterparts.

* Neural Network Calculations.  Illustrates the simple calculations carried out by artificial neurons, and the complex patterns when simple neurons are linked.

* Feed Forward Neural Networks. Provides details on how feed forward neural networks are created and trained.

* TensorFlow/Keras. Introduces the popular Python package, and guides exploration into building and training neural network models in Python.
