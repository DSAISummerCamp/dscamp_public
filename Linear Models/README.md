# Linear Models

This module introduces the concept of random numbers, regression and linear modelling of statistical data. The materials contain theory on linear/logistic/generalized regression and sklearn examples using Python programming language. The project of the module uses data obtained from [thisnetworkdoesnotexist](thisnetworkdoesnotexist.pythonanywhere.com).

# Outline (Random Numbers)

* Random numbers in everyday life.

* Statistical distributions and examples.

* Random variable transformations.

* Practicum in Jupyter Notebook.


# Outline (Linear Models)

* Introduction to linear modelling. Includes discussion on statistical relationship and causality. Provides motivating examples from scientific papers that use regression analysis.

* Linear regression. Discusses tasks that regression analysis tries to solve, assumptions required to model the data, and general functional form.

* Linear regression estimation. Provides details on how to estimate and assess fit of linear regression and give example of OLS estimation using sklearn.

* Logistic regression. Gives example of binary data and necessary steps needed to transition linear regression framework on binary space. Provides discussion on logit ("sigmoid") functional form.

* Logistic regression estimation. Provides discussion on methods of estimation of logistic regression and review methods to assess the performance of logistic regression model. Includes practical [example](#Project) on credit decisioning using logistic regression.

* Generalized Linear Models. Provides a quick review of beyond linear and logistic regression linear models.

# <a name="Project"></a> Project

Students will attempt to build a logistic regression model to predict ability of a person to repay loan. The project uses the social network data from [thisnetworkdoesnotexist](thisnetworkdoesnotexist.pythonanywhere.com). Students are asked to select proper features to obtain accurate and explainable model.
