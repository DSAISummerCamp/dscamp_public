# Project: Object Recognition by Neural Network models

## How to train your Neural Network:

0. The training data is collected by student using data_prep.ipynb
1. Read about weight initialization in "pt1_Weight_Initialization.ipynb".
2. Read about neural network optimizers in "pt2_Optimizers.ipynb".
3. Example at "pt3_Neural_Network_Example_CIFAR-10.ipynb"
4. Example at "pt4_optimizer_example.ipynb"

## Templates
1. Jupyter Notebook Template: 2022_project_template.ipynb

2. Presentation Template: NN team project presentation template for students.pptx

## Introduction of Project

2022 Camps:

Team Task:  build a Neural Network (NN) model to recognize paper, rock and Scissors in images. 


2021 Camps:

Team Task:  build a Neural Network (NN) model to recognize objects in images


## Training Data

2022 Camp:

The training data is collected by student using data_prep.ipynb. Examples are given in rps.zip.

The testing data is provided in rps_test.zip under this folder.

2021 Camp:

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32x3 color images in 10 equal classes, (6000 images per class). Each class of images corresponds to a physical object (automobile, cat, dog, airplane, etc). Dataset website: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

## Key Task

Bacis structure of the NN model is provided (ImageRecog NN Model template for students.ipynb). Students need to try different model parameters and settings in order to have the best model performance in accuracy on testing data set.


## Assessment of performance

The accuracy on the provided testing data set
