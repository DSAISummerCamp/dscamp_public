# Project: Object Recognition by Neural Network models

## Introduction
Team Task:  build a Neural Network (NN) model to recognize objects in images


## Training Data

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32x3 color images in 10 equal classes, (6000 images per class). Each class of images corresponds to a physical object (automobile, cat, dog, airplane, etc). Dataset website: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

## Key Task

Bacis structure of the NN model is provided (ImageRecog NN Model template.ipynb). Students need to try different model parameters and settings in order to have the best model performance in accuracy on testing data set.


## Assessment of performance

The accuracy on testing data set
