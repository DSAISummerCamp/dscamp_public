# Project: Object Recognition by Neural Network models

## How to train your Neural Network:

1. Read about weight initialization in "pt1_Weight_Initialization.ipynb".
2. Read about neural network optimizers in "pt2_Optimizers.ipynb".
3. See the neural network in action in "pt3_Neural_Network_Example_CIFAR-10.ipynb"

## Learning Step
1.Go over the "Team project for NN.pptx" (45 mins)

2.Go over the example in "ImageRecog NN Model template for instructors.ipynb" (20 mins)

3.Share the code template (ImageRecog NN Model template for students.ipynb) and the presentation template (NN team project presentation template for students.pptx) (20 mins)


## Introduction of Project
Team Task:  build a Neural Network (NN) model to recognize objects in images


## Training Data

2022 Camp:

The training data is collected by student using data_prep.ipynb

2021 Camp:

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32x3 color images in 10 equal classes, (6000 images per class). Each class of images corresponds to a physical object (automobile, cat, dog, airplane, etc). Dataset website: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

## Key Task

Bacis structure of the NN model is provided (ImageRecog NN Model template for students.ipynb). Students need to try different model parameters and settings in order to have the best model performance in accuracy on testing data set.


## Assessment of performance

The accuracy on testing data set
