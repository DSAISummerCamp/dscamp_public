## Rock-Paper-Scissors Project

The goal of this project is to train neural network to recognize different hand gestures in the game of rock-paper-scissors. The students are encouraged to create their own data for this project and use it for training and performance assessment.

The project is structured as follows:

- _Data Collection_ folder contains Jupyter Notebook that allows students to create their own data using computer webcam and process data for as model ready dataset.

- _Templates_ folder contains files:

  - Training and testing pre-made datasets (_rps.zip_ and _rps\_test.zip_)
  - Utility functions (_dlutils.py_, _kerutils.py_)
  - Jupyter Notebook (_2022\_project\_template.ipynb_) and PowerPoint presentation (_NN team project presentation template for students.pptx_) templates.


The project is aimed to be covered in 4 half a day modules:

- Data Collection -- 1 module
- Model fitting and presentation prep -- 2 modules
- Students present their results -- 1 module

Each module is accompanied by a short lecture covering necessary theoretical background of the task. For lecture materials, please refer to [Project Object Recognition/Tutorials](https://github.com/DSAISummerCamp/dscamp_public/tree/master/Project%20Object%20Recognition/Tutorials) folder.
