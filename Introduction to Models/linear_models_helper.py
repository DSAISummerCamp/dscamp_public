# Importing modules and loading the data
# Note that statsmodels are used for logistic regression instead of sklearn
# The main reason - coefficient significant and testing is not available out of the box for sklearn
# There are minor differences in the model specification between logistic regression on statsmodels/sklearn
# See package documentation for more details
