# Project: AI Startup

## Introduction

The final project is an opportunity for participants of the camp to work together in groups to apply AI modeling ideas in new context.  In fact, the technology is evolving so quickly that there are certainly many useful ideas that have not yet been explored.

## The Mission

Each group will create an idea for an **AI-based starup company** where they will propose applying one or more of the AI techniques discussed over the course of the week to a novel application.  That is, their idea should use AI or Data Science to solve some problem not studied in depth.  

They will then **"pitch"** their idea to a comittee of "venture capitalists" (instructors from the camp) who will select a winning idea.

## Key Questions

* What is the problem that your company's idea will solve?
* How will Data Science and AI techniques from the camp solve this problem?
* What type of data will be needed to be obtained to train your AI model?  How will the company obtain that data?
* How will the company generate revenue from this model?


## Format

Each group should plan on giving a presentation to the larger group, addressing all of the key questions above.
