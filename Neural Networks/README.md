# Introduction to Neural Networks

This module introduces the basic concepts of artificial neural networks and the powerful software used to train them.  The material contains conceptual and simple mathematical foundations for neural networks, and examples and investigations using TensorFlow/Keras in the Python programming language.

# Outline

* Introduction artificial neural networks. Describes the historical, intuitive relationship between artificial neurons and neural networks with their biological counterparts.

* Neural Network Calculations.  Illustrates the simple calculations carried out by artificial neurons, and the complex patterns when simple neurons are linked.

* Feed Forward Neural Networks. Provides details on how feed forward neural networks are created and trained.

* TensorFlow/Keras. Introduces the popular Python package, and guides exploration into building and training neural network models in Python.

* Convolutional Neural Networks. Introduces the concepts behind convolutional neural networks, and important structure in many computer vision applications.  Students will train convolutional networks to predict the ages of the individuals in the photographs on [thisnetworkdoesnotexist](thisnetworkdoesnotexist.pythonanywhere.com).





# Project

Students will train a neural network as a Santa Claus detector.  After training, the network will be able to evalute an image as either a picture of Santa, or not.
