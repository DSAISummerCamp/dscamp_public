What's the matter dear?
Uuuuuuugh!!
Hey sweetheart will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
Have I done the right thing?
To the bathroom where do you think?
Now where are you going?
I didn't break your precious clock Roy!
Nice going honey.  It was brand new.
Roy?  Your clock broke.
Well thanks a lot.
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
Aren't you glad we waited?
I was just going to say "eight."  You're fantastic!
Eight o'clock?
Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
Definitely.  I think you may be a very gifted telepath.
Do you think I have it Dr. Venkman?
Well I guess some people have it and some don't.
Well you're doing great.  Keep it up.
No.  They're just coming to me.
Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here are you?
Ummm -- figure eight?
Ready?  What is it?
It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good.
Is it a star?
All right what happened to me?
I'm innocent!  Honest Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
Oh sure.  I'm getting used to this.
I am Zuul.
Are you the Gatekeeper?
I got the Twister game for later ...
Fine Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
Great!  Bring her too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
Well actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
Hey it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
Hi Louis.
Oh Dana it's you.
I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
Oh that's nice Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods but you know that.  Listen that reminds me I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
No thanks Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
Oh no I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
Are you sick Louis?
... I thought it was the drug store.
Hi Louis.
Oh Dana it's you ...
Talk to my accountant. 
This is going to cost you you know.  Our fees are ridiculously high.
Thank you.  Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.
Yeah along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
Really!  Is it gone?
Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
Whoa!! Nice voice.
There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana speak to me ...
I am Zuul.  I am ...
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
I want you inside me.
Actually it's more of a policy than a rule.
Take me now.
Well I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
Do you want this body?
Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
He is the Destructor.
Okay I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
Hey Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
I've got to go now.
I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
All right.  Since you put it that way.
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
What's he doing in my refrigerator.
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
Hittites  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
Well the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
You must have gotten the last copy.
I'll cancel the reservation  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
Can't you tell me now?
Yes but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
Is he dying or something?
The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
Who's the stiff?
I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
You're the best one in your row.
You heard it?
Great rehearsal.
No kiss?
Goodbye.
Okay.  Then I'll go.
All right.
Okay okay.  But if anything else happens you have to promise you'll call me.
Then leave.
Don't scream.
I'll scream.
I want to help you.
Out!
On a purely scientific basis.
That's it.  Get out.
I think I should spend the night here.
All right.  What do you want to do?
I'm a qualified psychologist.  I've got a degree and everything.  I believe that something happened here and I want to do something about it.
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
If it's any comfort to you I don't think you're crazy.
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
There's nothing there now and I don't get any significant readings.
Yeah yeah.
Are you all right?
Damn!
I know.  It happened by itself.
I told you I ...
You're quite a housekeeper.
I'll wait here if you don't mind.
Well let's check it out.
Uh-huh.
Nothing.  Is that the kitchen?
What?
That's too bad.
Thanks.  What's in there?
Like a used car salesman.
No?  What do I act like?
You really don't act like a scientist.
Yeah but it's got a great cello break.
That's a violin concerto.
I'd have to say Prokofiev's third concerto.
Really?  Do you have a favorite piece?
You play the cello!  It's my favorite instrument.
No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm not ready to do that.
Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
Spengler  see if you can find the word "Zuul" in any of the literature.  I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment.
No just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
It's in the stars.
Is that your professional opinion?
Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
So what do you think it was?
... and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.
Barrett.  Dana Barrett.
We're all professionals here Miss ...
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
I see.
Dr. Venkman we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You however seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist Dr. Venkman and you have no place in this department or in this University.
But why?  The students love us!
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
No we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
I trust you're moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
That would definitely explain it.
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
Yeah it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
Well that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
Definitely some sort of fighting Spaniel I think.
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
That is one speedy mutt.
We'll get back to you.
Did you see it?  What was it?
Back off man!  I'm a scientist!
What's that got to do with it?
One thing at a time.  We don't even know what it is yet.
Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
Hello I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
Thank you.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
I don't believe in luck.
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
What is it?
I want you to have this. 
That's so romantic.
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
In the physical sense.
Die in what sense?
Egon there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.
Remind me not to go to lunch with you.
I think it's the food of the future.
Oh that's very - unusual.
I collect spores molds and fungus.
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
Is that a game?
That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
Print is dead.
You're very handy I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot too.
Oh really?  Well I've quit better jobs than this one believe me.
Janine I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
I didn't ask him.  All I know is that I haven't had a break in two weeks and you promised you'd hire more help.
The EPA?  What's he want?
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
Here are tonight's calls.
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
What calls?
Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it.  Hold all my calls Janine.
Yes sir.  Don't worry.  We handle this kind of thing all the time.
Heavens no!  The owners don't like us to even talk about it.  I hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
Did you ever report it to anyone?
Well most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad though.
Has this ever happened before?
Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
... or you can accept the fact that this city is heading for a disaster of really Biblical proportions.
That's "Peck!"
Mr. Mayor it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...
Probably a mixture of gases no doubt stolen from the Army ...
The man is a psychopath Your Honor.
See!  They are using drugs.
You turned off the power!  Look there was another man here ... You have to find him and bring him back.  A short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
Forget it Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn smart-ass.
At ease Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.
Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!
Have it your way Mr. Venkman.
Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
Well because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance the storage of noxious possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
Why do you want to see it?
May I please see the storage facility?
The magic word is "please."
And what is the magic word Mr. Venkman?
Because you didn't say the magic word.
And why not Mr. Venkman?
No you may not.
And may I see this storage facility?
Yes it would.
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
In a storage facility.
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
I'm not at liberty to say.
And how many ghosts have you caught Mr. Venkman?
You could say that.
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
Exactly what are you a doctor of Mr. Venkman?
Yes I'm Doctor Venkman.
Are you Peter Venkman?
Great!  How's it going?
I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency Third District.
Can I help you?
Then my theory was correct.
I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
Yeah but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
You volunteered didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
Sorry.  This isn't your day.
Two wavy lines?
Well just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
Yes.  I don't like this.
Nervous?
Close -- but definitely wrong.
Circle?
Good guess -- but no.
A square?
All right.  What is it?
Wow!
On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns would he feel it or what?
I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
Yeah yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
Hey Mister!  Can I see those guns?
When you were in the bathroom did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
The wet towels residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
What on earth gave you that idea?
Were you recently in the bathroom?
Yes?
But it's my favorite state.
Life is just a state of mind.
No!  You said crossing the beams would be BAD.  It'll kill her!  And us!
No!  Them!  Shoot them!  Cross the beams.
On the count of three!  One ... Two ...
Full-stream with strogon pulse.
What now?
Get a grip on yourself Egon.  I talked to Dana Barrett and she referred to Gozer as the Destructor.
You talked to Gozer?
Gozer.
Who?
She said he was "the Destructor."
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals bizarre rituals intended to bring about the end of the world.
Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
Of course!  Ivo Shandor  I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started a secret society in 1920.
Oh shit!
Where's the Keymaster?
If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
He wants to shut down the storage grid.
All right Peter.  Good night.
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
All right.  I'll try.
You have to keep him there.  Do whatever you have to but don't let him leave  He could be very dangerous.
I agree.
Yeah yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
Does she want to be?
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
What is it?
It's Peter Egon.  I've got a problem.
It's hard to explain but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension.
What do you mean "bad?"
Trust me.  It will be bad.
Why not?
Don't cross the beams.
What?
Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.
Yeah I can smell it.
Something was definitely here.
Didn't see anything  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.
Did you see anything?
She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
Generally you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think Egon?
Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
Just for your information Ray the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75000.
Wow!
I'm always serious.
Spengler are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
Egon somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?
Oh this is big Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
What have you got Egon?
Oh!  You're here.
That appears to be the case.
You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
And look at this Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
The storage facility blew.  This one ...  ... shut off the protection grid.
What happened??!!!?
I'm worried Ray.  It's getting crowded in there.  And all my recent data points to something big on the bottom.
I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
I've got to sleep.
Neutronize.  System shut.
Set entry grid.
Easy ... Easy ... I'm going to throw in my trap now.
It's working!
God it's ugly!
Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?
We'd better adjust our streams.
Sorry Buddy!
I blame myself.
I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
Or even a race memory stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
You know Peter this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
Great!  The marshmallows are about to get their revenge.
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
Look!
What?  What popped in there?
I couldn't help it!  It just popped in there!
Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!
Agile bastard isn't he?
Well that ought to do it.
As a duly-constituted representative of the City of New York and on behalf of the County and State of New York the United States of America the Planet Earth and all its inhabitants I hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension.
I don't think it's Shandor.
It doesn't seem to have slowed him down any.
He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
Who was the architect?
No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
I guess they don't build them like they used to huh?
It's not good Pete.
Egon how's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
I can't take much more of this.  The pace is killing me.
Boy that was a rough one.
I don't know.  I'm just guessing.
How do you know?
Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
It's here Ray.  It's looking at me.
Well hurry up.  The needle's going wild.
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
Third floor.  Get down here
Where are you Pete?
Ray -- Something's here.
All right.  Let's cool the negative vibes. These things can sense them.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See I told you we'd get something.
Sure.  Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back.  No problem.
No sense worrying about it now.
So do I.
Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
They will.
It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
How was your date?
Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember?
Why don't I check out the building?  It may have a history of psychic turbulence.
Fourteen hundred.
Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
Everybody can relax.  I found the car.  How do you like it?
This might do ... I don't know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper don't you think?  We're trying to keep our costs down.  You know how it is when you're starting a new company.
Wow!  Does this pole still work?
Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.
But most people are afraid to even report these things.
But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
My parents left me that house I was born there.
You'll never regret this Ray.
To go into business for ourselves.
For what purpose?
Let me tell you Ray everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate call it luck Karma whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
Ray I apologize.  I guess my confidence in the Regents was misplaced.  They did this to Galileo too.
You said you floored 'em at the Regents' meeting.
Yeah but I introduced you guys.  You never would've met if not for me.  That's got to be worth something.
If anyone deserves it it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
If you guys are right if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
Oh yeah.  This could be bigger than the microchip.  They'll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us.  We're probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady.
I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
"Get her?"  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?
Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  I know what to do. Stay close.  I have a plan.
Hey Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
Anything!  Just make contact.
What do I say?
I don't know.  Talk to it.
What do we do now?
I told you it's real.
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
What is it?
Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
Well I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
Looked at with your eyes.
What do you mean by "seen?"
Ray as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
No this one's for real Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.
Sure.  That's great Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
Peter at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue ten people witnessed a free-roaming vaporous full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
What do you mean "choose?"  We don't understand.
What's he talking about?  Choose what?
LATER MAN!!
Stantz?  You okay in there?
Right.  We'll believe anything.
You don't have to worry about that with us sir.
Well has it ever occurred to you that the reason you've been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
Yeah Judgement Day.
Judgement Day ...
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
And the seas would boil ...
Ray do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
Me too. Parts of the Bible are great.
No.  But I liked Jesus' style.
Do you believe in God?
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
Me too.
Mmmhmmm.
Are you a Christian Ray?
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
Yeah I heard that.  Now tell me what you really do.
Very impressive resume.  Electronic countermeasures Strategic Air Command ... Black belt in Karate ... Small arms expert ... Mr. Zeddemore as you may have heard we locate ghosts and spirits trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes offices and places of worship.
Absolutely not.
Now will you get in the flask?
No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
Is this a joke?
Adrian I'm asking you nicely in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
Little Nicky.
Hey that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
I hear a train coming. Drink.
Let her go.
Of course I can. Drink or she dies.  Unlike you she won't come back from where she's going.
How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
Yeah he needs souls to live. When you guys left you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.
He's sick?
Adrian you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
Please get out of my mind!
You shouldn't have come here.
ADRIAN!
Don't do it!
No!
I was going to let you out eventually Cassius. I swear.
Thank you Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
You mother...
You know New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
All right. Let me out.
Hello Cassius.
Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
I lowered the drinking age to ten.
Well we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
"Let the sin begins" -- that was a good one.
It's our time brother.
...their damned souls will be ours.
Eventually Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
We could create our own hell there.
What do you think about... Earth?
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
That's what I thought!
Yeah get out of here! Beat it!
Um excuse me we're having a private conversation here.
It's just such a slap in the face.
And he's dead serious.
You work your ass off for ten thousand years hurting people helping others hurt people then you get a decision like that.
I've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
I knew it. He's finally retiring.
You want a queen? Got one right here.
Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
I'm calling you out brother...
Urr... uggg... errr...
Oh Nicky I've missed you. Come on out and say hello...
Uh. No it won't?
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
And give you a good buzz.
Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in uh... er science magazine.
It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
Sure why not?
But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?
Noon...
Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected back?
I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
She goes to Parson's right?
Show him Central Park.
All these good people have totally been led astray.
You know we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
I'll call her later.
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
I remember that night you had like four daiquiris.
So excited.
Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you I am so excited right now.
You're already there...
Well Mommy get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
It would be so okay.
Well nice meeting you Jenna Christa.  Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes you'll know what to do.
What is it?
A speech impediment?
Stronger yes. Smarter definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
Yeah you do...
I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
She's so nice.
Valerie's crying!
We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
How did you see me?
Well tell her I said "hi" back.
Hello... yes he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot he's my son you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God I will call you back goodbye.  That was my friend Michelle she says "hi."
It was a long time ago at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
Where did you meet my father?
Angels don't get any older son.
How come you're not older?
Well she was about six-three only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
Wow. What... what did she look like?
Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
An angel?
Try an angel.
My mom wasn't a goat?
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
Okay can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
Maybe try the opposite of that.
The home of eternal damnation house of Hades H.E. double toothpicks...
That turn you on there RuPaul?
Oh my God he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
I can't screw.  I can't screw.
They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows he can't piss smoke.
He'll be here. Just keep your cool kid.
Where is he? He's late.
No.
Did you just talk?
Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
What's Nicky doing down there?
He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."
This is baloney!
I think you're looking at him.
I was with Valerie I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
I didn't murder anybody
The shit has hit the fan kid. Take a look.
I seem to be in trouble Beefy.
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
I'm just saying there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.
Release the evil?
You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil bat's blood moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
"But those are my roommate's sodas..." Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?
But those are my roommate's sodas...
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
What can I do about it?
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
Well let's rock and roll.
Come on there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
Okay just point me in the right direction next time.
Look it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
Put it in your mouth.
So far so good. Now what?
That pain is hunger.
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
You're on Earth now kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
It's freezing up here Beefy.
Makin' friends already.
Oh. Sorry.
It's not me moron.
The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
I mean... tough break.
Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be... me.
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
This was a very difficult decision because I have three wonderful sons. I mean Adrian so smart so ruthless. And Cassius so strong so tough. And Nicky so... so...
Okay kid we'll listen to it later.
Hey Dad I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
Now everybody sit down.
Cassius didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
Nothing Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
Beast.
Bus?
You got it.
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
Thanks.
That's a pretty brassiere.
Hey.
That's what I'm thinkin'...
Coulda been much worse.
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs right?
I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies I catch everything...
That's nice Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
Boogerland!
What was it called sir.
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
It's Stanley sir.
You know what was in Hell when I came down here Cassius?
I started slow though. For years I was just giving people hot foots. Actually you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration. She was an ugly one too. One day she asked me if I wanted super sex. I said I'll take the soup.
I know your wickedness.
You know I was the one who created Hell.
I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
You were gone ten seconds. What happened?
You're the spawn of Satan. You got it in you.
I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
You're not saying it's up to me?
I'm just a demon Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
So go get 'em Jimmy!
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
Nothing's getting through that. The fire is solid as a rock.
Okay but Jimmy when the house is rockin' don't forget the knockin'!
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
Hey...
Of course you do Tommy Tune.
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
Oh would you grow up.
Easy Liberace.
No.
By she do you mean he?
I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
This don't look good.
Peppermint... alright.
Schnapps...
We know where to find Nicky.
Looking for the chief.
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
You sure you're down with this?
We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands right now. Wanna come Nicky?
That's a big pass Elton John.
Six six six pick up sticks.
Look who's back from the dead.
The Dark Prince is here.
Did you check out the dragon mouth?
Yeah. You do it.
Should we wake him up?
Yo man I think that devil guy just got ripped off.
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
What's with that guy?
Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
There's our man.
'Bout time...
Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.
See ya fellas.
Whoa that chick must be the real deal then. Later on.
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
Not again fellas. It kind of hurts.
Come on. One more time.
Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
What's Ozzy trying to say there?
That way.
Which way did he go?
I was DeNiro!
Yes great movie...
Recently yes! So I run up behind this guy and start bashing his brains in with this bat and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
You keep a bat under your seat?
I followed him all the way downtown and when he gets out of the car I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
You followed him?
So I followed him...
Oh that's terrible Reege...
So I was driving to work today and some bozo in a Cadillac cut me off...
I'll just go to Heaven.
You gotta kill yourself.
Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.
Dude. Seriously?
Good idea... kill me.
Dude it's us. Let us in.
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
All right...
Please. You got to.
Oh. Sorry Andrew. Valerie?
You got the wrong window again man.
Andrew.
Adrian?
I don't need luck. I'm good.
Thanks much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
Valerie Doran? Two floors up one window over.
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
You smell like coconuts.
Hello.
I love you.
I love you.
Do me.
From my dad's side of the family.
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
That was Cassius!
Nicky!
I have to Valerie.
Don't do it.
"Mister Crowley what's inside of your head..."
I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
East Rutherford.
We're going to Jersey?
Next time. Tonight I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
Can we go fly over Central Park?
Okay I do. Get back up here.
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
..."The Devil?"...
Well that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me but not with my brothers so they broke out of Hell causing my dad...
Yes...
Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
What do you mean "possessed?"
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
Look just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
Why would you be floating?
I think I'm floating.
What are you doing?
No.
Are you dead?
Valerie?
I'm not sure but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
What were you thinking coming here?
Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
Hey.
I... I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that...
What was that?
Your juicy heart-shaped ass.
What?
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you Valerie?
You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.
Basically yeah.
So you're saying make all pants with a drawstring then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
Good. I was concerned.
Sometimes sure.
Valerie it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
My perfume?
What's that pleasant smell coming from your skin?
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
School?
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
I'm not sure. I'd ask him but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
You have a dog? What kind?
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows though.
This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
It's not that cold. Here let me wrap it.
It's freezing my hands.
Uh it's a deep south expression.
"Octopus people?"
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
If you want to.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
Here have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
Well I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
If I don't save him I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
My dad's in hell and he's falling apart.
My dad's an optometrist.
I don't know but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
Why are you laughing?
Yeah. Deep south.  She laughs along with him not sure why.
Really?
The South.
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
You think I'm a tourist?
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
That just hurt a lot.
Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a shoulder to cry on?
A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl Valerie.
If it's Cassius yes.
A black guy?
It looks like the work of a brother...
And sorry man but no dogs allowed.
I don't know.
Why is that funny?
Yeah. The deep South.
It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
No.
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
Off limits.
Eight-hundred split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
Yes. What is rent?
Uh don't you want to know what the rent is?
Hello friend my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
Sir I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
Okay now you gone and done it. You done messed with my business bitch!
I don't know?
RUN!
What --
I'm sorry John but you have to run again.
Oh Jesus...
She's not alive but she didn't die.
She's still alive?
She grew up.
She died?
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
Who wanted her little girl back?
Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
I am going back.  I see myself there.
Agatha you're never going back there.
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank I won't remember any of this.
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
The other two will die without me.
Why?
I have to go back.
Someplace safe.
Where are we going?
But you still have a choice.  The others never had a chance to see their future.  You did.
I can't leave.  You said so yourself there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
Please I want to go back...
You were right.  I'm not being set up.
Anderton --
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
What is it?
Oh God...
I have to find out what happened to my life.  Agatha.  I'm not going to kill the man.  I don't even know him.
Please --
I can't.  I have to know.
Anderton leave.
He's here.
Wait.
Agatha...
He won't.
He'll turn around.
No.  Follow him.
Do it.  Right here.  On the ground.
Forget that guy --
Drop some money.
What?
Can you see the balloon man?
Agatha --
Agatha...
Take it.
Who?
They're inside.
What?
Is it now?
What?
Is it now?
I'm sorry but I need your help. You contain information.  I need to know how to get it.  Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?  Can you tell me if --
Can you see?
Wally!
How did I not see this?  Agatha who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?
John?  What is it?
I know... I do too...
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
Anne Lively...
About who?
Because I found out about her...
Think John.  Why would they set you up?
Somewhere.
Found?  Where?
Just some guy... they found.
Then who was he?
-- but he didn't.
-- go blind.  I know.
I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then or you'll --
Organic microbots that reconstruct the nerves and blood vessels. It'll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs.  But whatever you do don't scratch.
The nano... what?
I know you're in a hurry so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
I can't even stand up --
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
Here --
How do I find the --
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
So uh if you were a plastic surgeon before...
And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others but let's change the subject shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?
You set your patients on fire!
They were performance pieces.
You made those tapes...
Yes you did.
I put you away --
Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
From where?  D.C.?
Oh yes.
We know each other?
You don't remember me do you?
Tell you what since you and I go way back I'll give you my Old Pal discount.  How's that sound?
It's all I could safely move.
That's not much.
Whatever you say John.
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
Why?
I know that but I wanna keep the old ones.
And replace them with new ones.
Yeah --
Anesthesia.  Try to relax John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
Right.  I know --
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
That's comforting.
Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
It's actually kind of a rush.  They say you get visions; that your life flashes before your eyes.  That all your dreams come true.
Lara --
You're part of my flock now John. Welcome.
So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?
Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
Hey you wanna know where the word came from "glitch?"
No... we have the two previsions from the twins right here but...  ... I can't pull up any data from the female.  Probably just a glitch.
Try again.
Huh we don't seem to have her data.
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
Not to mention "Saved by the bell".
... Graveyard shift.
Hence the expression...
I work graveyard swing and day all by my lonesome.
You the only sentry?
For that we have to go for a ride.
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
That's an old one.  One of our first.
This about the Justice Department?  They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  Told me to wear a tie.  You like this one?
Victim's a white female.
Drowning.
Kill type?
No you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
I don't ever see any of you precops down here I'm not in trouble am I?
Yes sir.  I'm Gideon.  The music relaxes the prisoners.
You the sentry?
Then go ahead pull the trigger.
No doubt.
No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.
Beauty?  The precogs don't even always agree with each other!
People want to believe in the system.  That's the beauty of it...
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
John --
Everybody runs.
You can't run --
I'm not getting halo'd.
John.  Please.  Listen to me --
John.  Just tell me who's Leo Crow?
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar I need you to talk to Wally see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
We're years from that.  John I'm asking you: please come in we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
Can you fake the cerebral output?
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
All right John just take a breath let's think about this...
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
And who the hell is that?
Somebody named Leo Crow.
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
Justice already knows.  Talk to me John.  Tell me what's happening?
Just so you know I've overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --
No?  How's an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?
We won't let them.
You understand John that the minute Precrime goes national they're going to take it away from us.
I'm fine Lamar.
What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
In the middle of the night?
I go running down there.
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
I'm fine.
She's worried about you.  And quite frankly so am I.
What?
Lara called me.
He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us John.
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there.  And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
And you say the third prevision was what a little fuzzy or something?
Tuck in your shirt.
I understand.  What's the other thing?
You can let him look around answer his questions but watch him.  If there's any problems make sure we know about it first.
Yes sir.
I need you to do two things for me. One watch Danny Witwer.
I understand.  Sir.
You understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
Don't apologize John.
Lamar I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
Hang on Lamar --
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
Uh-huh...
Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
The nation votes this week...
Don't worry Lamar.
Tell me not to worry John.
You don't have to chase me Fletcher.
You don't have to do this Chief.
Everybody runs.
Don't run Chief.  You know we'll catch you.  You trained us.
I show a cop on horseback.
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
The brick has been repointed the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
What he's doing now we call "scrubbing the image" looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
Uh sir...
All I need some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went check all relations --
I wrote it down in your calendar then left a message at your house --
You're kidding that's today?
Chief the investigator from the Fed is here.
Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
Seventeen minutes.
Take your time.
Sure Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
Uh yeah you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
Still scrubbing... looks like there's a third party somebody wearing shades just out the window...
Any ID on the shooter yet?
Confirm with trig and image.
That was easy.
I show time of occurrence Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
Check NCIC maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And Jad I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
Amazing there's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that.
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
Red Ball?
We're in motion on something.
Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
Go back to work.  All of you.
Sir?
Uh-huh.  Jad?
Come on Chief you think about it the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
You guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he's talking about.
Did Marks close the front door?!
What?
Did he close the front door?
Go ahead.
Now look at him...
Yeah?  So?
Look at the kid.  In this one he's on the left of the man in the suit.
Georgetown.
The mall?
No maglev system.
Somewhere near the capital?
From solar position Trig & Image confirms it at approximately eight oh-four a.m.
Send a DCPD blue & white out there set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
Run the subscription list...
We can't grab it...
Case #1108 previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
Red Ball -- double homicide: one male one female.  Killer's male white 40's.
Okay Jad what's coming?
Possession alone will cost you six months not to mention your badge.
You gonna tell on me?
It seems I've found a flaw John  You.
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
You set me up...
I agree.  The system is perfect. If there's a flaw it's human.  It always is.  Thank you for the tour Wally.
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
Flaws.
Why don't you cut the cute act Danny and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
I don't know.  He was shot and killed when I was fourteen on the steps of his church in Bethesda.
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.
The oracle isn't where the power is anyway.  The power's always been with the priests.  Even if they had to invent the oracle.
Just a nickname.
But you call this room the "temple".
The precogs are pattern recognition filters nothing more.
I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
If it's a question of authority.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
Really?  You've never been inside?
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
To them.
To Hineman?
Speaking of interfacing I'd love to say hello.
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs designed the system and pioneered the interface.
Then why can't they see rapes or assaults... or suicides?
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do only what you will do.
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
But it didn't fall.  You caught it.
Yes.
You're certain?
Because it was going to fall.
Why did you catch that?
Yes it is.
But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
You mind if I tag along?
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
As I recall they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
I'm sorry Danny but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
Just go to the beginning!
There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
Are these all of her previsions?
Oh... Hi John.
I like you Wally so I'm not gonna kick you or hit you with anything but only if you promise to help me...
Do I know you?  Who are you?
Wally listen to me...
She said...
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
She spoke to me.
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
She was looking right at me.
She grabbed you?  Impossible.  The Precogs aren't even aware of us. In the milk all they see is the future.
Nothing... she grabbed me and then there was an image on the screen...
Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
It helps if you don't think of them as human.
They're not in any pain.  We keep their heads pretty well stocked with dopamine and endorphins. Plus we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels -- don't want 'em to drift off to sleep but they can't be kept too awake either.
Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
I can't touch you!  And John you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
Uh I'll try...
Rufus play it back...
I guess that's all of it.
What happened?  Where's the rest?
Tell me how.
Stop --
Then take her to Radio Shack.
They don't belong to anybody.
I tell you what.  I do this I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
So now I need you to hack into her.
So?
C'mon Rufus you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
She's got information inside of her.  I need you to get it out.
I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do!  And I swear I didn't do any of the stuff I did!
Rufus for Christ's sake get up.
Are you reading my mind right now?
That's right.
She's a precog?
Rufus.  She's a precog.
I'm impressed Anderton.  You're on the lam but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
Well hello there honey-pie.
I need help with her.
Well hey you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you Chief I make housecalls...
I need your help.
Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus what's up with your eye?
Hold your breath Dad...
Sean wait...
I'm your son.  I'm you.
Who are you?
Good-bye Dad...
I wanted to.
I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
I was looking for you...
The more you want to believe something the easier it is to be fooled.
I forgive you...
Once I even told him I loved him.
I forgive you.
I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
Sean --
The funny thing is I started to believe he really was my Dad.
Oh Sean --
No.  He got tired of pretending.
You're alive?
I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
What the hell.
Wanna hear something funny?
It's a little late for that.
You gotta have faith Dad.
Sean -- you're not real.
All right I'll try...
Come on!
Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way on my best day I could ever beat twelve seconds!
Okay... now let me time you.
I love you too!  I love you daddy.  Love ya dad.
Four.  Wow.  What a big boy.  I love you Sean.
What a big boy.  How old are you?
I won!
That's great.
I scored a goal!
Good-bye Crow.
You're not gonna kill me...
Let go of the gun.
Tell me!
Kill me!
Who made you do this?
If I tell you my family gets nothing.
Tell me who was it set this up?
Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me Goddammit before I lose my nerve!
What about the picture --
What the fuck is going on?
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is the next day I was out so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look man you gotta go through with this.
I'm asking you again who made you do this?
Look believe me I know it's hard but you gotta do it --
Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
Look I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
Who said I would?
You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
If you don't kill me my family gets nothing!
The precogs were wrong.
But you have to.  They said you would.
No.
You're not gonna kill me?
NO!
It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --
I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.
Where've you got him?  Is he all right?  Tell me you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!
He's alive?
... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song made him laugh bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
His name was Sean.  Six years ago. Francis pool.
Some -- somebody's father?
Do you know who I am?
Did I?  I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --
Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
The female.
Which one is that?
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
How do I even know which one has it?
Sometimes in order to see the light you have to risk the dark.
I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
You're insane or you think I am.
Actually I think you'll have to run out but yes that's what you have to do.
-- and then walk out.
If... you have one.
That's all huh?  Just walk right into Precrime go into the Temple somehow tap into the Precogs and then download this Minority Report...
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
Where?
The safest place of all.
What safe place is that?
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
You said they're destroyed.
You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
Why should I trust you?
Hold that thought.
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
You want to bring it down.
Do you?  Really?
I believe in that system...
The system would collapse.
Insignificant to you maybe but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
Yes of course he knew but at the time he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well in my experience parents often see their children as they want them to be not as they are.
Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might just might have an alternate future.
You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people?
Obviously for Precrime to function there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable but it's still doubt.
Why?
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
Most of the time all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while one of them will see things differently than the other two.
What?
I can't help you.  No one can.  The Precogs are never wrong.
So you won't help me?
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
Not if I stay away from him.
And yet a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now isn't it?
You say some of the children died?
Back then he was still a DA and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way you know paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
And how did Lamar become involved?
It began as play.  A guessing game like you play with any toddler except these children always guessed right.  And then the nightmares started. They were all different but all the same.  They were all about murder.  And the murders were all happening.
You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.
You're talking about the precogs...
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
Heal who?
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them not turn them into... something else.
You don't seem all that proud.
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention then yes I invented precrime.
What's so funny?
And how would I know that?
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
I'm... not... a... killer.
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
The vine -- the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall...
The what?
Yes I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
I'm a little dizzy...
Something wrong?
Lara I don't know why this is happening.  I just know they're setting me up.  I can't trust anybody.  I don't know who to talk to or where to go...  Lara?  Are you there?
Then how did he --
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
Oh God what did you do?
He's dead Lara.
John?
Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
Lamar --
But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
No.  I don't think you do.  The other day when he came to the cottage he talked about a lot of things but Danny Witwer the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
I understand.
No.  That's what everyone thinks.  John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
Sean --
Lamar do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
He also said Crow was a fake.
We know why John was tagged.
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
I don't know who that is.
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
Who?
I was but this whole incident with John made me realize the fragility of what we've built here.  This is John's legacy as much as mine and I want to protect that.
I thought you were retiring?
It's insanity around here.
You look great.
I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
No it isn't Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
This is all my fault.
Thank you.  This is Burgess.
You have an emergency call on your private line.
I padded your expense account for the last six months.
How did you get this?
My God...
Congratulations sir.
I'll be right there.
Sir the press conference is starting.
Not.  Now.
He just wanted a few minutes before --
Tell him not now.
The guy from USA Today is here.
Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things Danny?  Because right now the Precogs can't see.
What?
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
Of course it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place someone fairly high up --
Yes.
So there is a way to fool the system?
We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
Precog Deja Vu...
Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
By fooling the system.  All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place then a few minutes later commit the crime in exactly the same way.
How?
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
Danny tell me what you're thinking.
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is why would someone want this erased from the data file?
I know.  He came to me told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
According to the Sentry Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
This murder is happening at two different times.
I don't understand --
Now the second image.  Watch the water.  The wind's changed.  The ripples are going the other way.
Not quite.
It's the same prevision.
Yes.  This is from the twins Arthur and Dashiel.  Agatha's stream was missing.  Now this one is from the cyberparlor.  Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch...
He told me about this.  You got this from Containment?
Wait just a second...
Good God.  What was that?
Where are you?
I don't wanna say over the phone but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
What?
Lamar I found something.
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
He's my subordinate!
Oh it's all my damn business now Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
None of your damn business.
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
The man lost a child for Christ's sake...
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping yet you did nothing about it.
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year and I'm inclined to agree.
He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
Get the hell outta here.  You sick bastard.
No I wanna kill my boss!
Uh yeah being concert master of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
Good.  What I can do is set you up down in the --
Right here.
Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
I wanna kill my boss.
Near Death's real popular right now which includes everything from getting hit by a car to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush you come out the other side without a heart attack.
None.  This was arranged.
How many?
I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy Gordon?
Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
What kind of cop were you before this?
They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
If you were a child killer you took these pictures would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
I don't know why?
There a maid in this hotel?
No.  He can't...
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
He's trying to prove his innocence.
She's in the room with him when he kills Crow.  She's already a part of his future.
We can stop him.
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
Two?
There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
Because he thinks he's innocent.
No offense sir but why wouldn't he just run?
Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket.  There's fewer consumers down there which means fewer scanners to target him.
They're everywhere.
There's thousands of units like this one.
Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
Yes I know.
Sir the team's gonna be light without those men.
What?!
Actually Gordon you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
Somehow I don't think that was Walt Whitman.
Because of the nature of murder.  "There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".
I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
People have gotten the message.  Gum?
Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
That's the Red Ball Alarm.
Can't they shut that off?
Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes we go national there's gonna be nowhere to run.
So if you wanna kill someone you take him to Miami.
Nice to meet you.  Gum?
This is Evanna the team pilot.
You "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years not one damn murder...
John Anderton was my friend!
Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
Why don't I feel like celebrating?
Knott!
People if you don't let the spyder scan you we'll have to come in and arrest you.
It's not at all that you don't trust me to be alone with the Chief.  That you think I might you know fuck with him if I had the chance...
I think you're swell company Knott.
That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie isn't it?
I forgot my glasses.
Howard --
Sure.  Raincheck.
Raincheck?
Ah.  That must be why you look so nice.
I'd love to but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
We could have lunch together.
I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
What about your meeting?
How can you even tell?  You know how blind you are without your glasses.
The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
Who?
He looks familiar.
But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
I haven't seen him in two years.
To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later he's going to contact you.
To what?  Trap him?
You know I need to use you.
I left him because every time I looked at him I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
Not very well I'm sure.  I'd probably start doping myself.  Or maybe I'd...
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son let's see how well you handle it.
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement Lara...
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway John was upset. He... he...
What was it then?
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
Yes.
But John was with him at the pool?
It was nobody's fault.
You mean after he lost your son.
Since right after we lost our son.
Have you been there recently?
That was our apartment.
So you haven't seen his apartment?
No but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
No.
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
I don't have any sugar either.
He's not here now is he?
We used to every summer.
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
Cream and sugar.
Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
I like it.
Yes.
This your work?
I know who you are.
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
Jesus...
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female she's the key.  She's the one they listen to the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
Wally the other two can still function right?
But there's still the other two.
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
What does he want with a precog?
They've never been separated before.
Tell me how all this works.
Shhh!  They're sleeping.
Nice to meet you Wally.
They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins. Wires got crossed between hands and feet.
"4/17: Subject when unaware of observation prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet."
I can't explain this Alice but I'm not so sure it did. It's as if...he's <u>not Stu</u> any more. The Stu I love is gone! <i></i> He spends all his time in the garage. He says he's...autographing.
Julie that stuff probably saved his life.
The thing is I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.
Five CC's.
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
What's the maximum safe dose?
Wow - two guys in the same brain. - Which one did you fall in love with?
Left-handed he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff and make me laugh and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
Monkeybone?
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
What?
Switch hands.
How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.
Jesus honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him but I never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
Yeah...before your time.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
Who did this?
I don't know. I guess it was...
Special occasion?
Oh poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting and the carnival rides and watching people's <u>nightmares</u>. And of course I need not <u>add</u> -
Aw buck up. Have another 'tini.
Three months Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
Hey Stu why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
Yo Jumbo. We got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
I was uh just getting ready to leave...
I didn't say anything.
<i></i> I beg your pardon?
Sad commentary huh?
Jeez it all looks like bad late-night cable.
Yeah I've seen a few of your dreams. You're quite a celebrity down here.
Stu Miley.
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
Olive or eyeball?
Uhh - martini?
Yeah I know - Picasso. <u>Guernica</u> right? That's what everybody says - although personally I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking?
Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
Thank me next time you see me.
Death! Thank you!
It's irregular but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
Back? You're sending me back?
Back in your head where he belongs. <i></i> No offense Stu but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
Fine thanks. Saw my girl said goodbye everything's gonna be okay. <i></i> I guess I'm yours now.
I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
DEATH!!
Bend over?
<i>De nada</i>. Now come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
Coming from you that's quite a compliment.
If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.
Well - you'd need a body.
Death I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
<u>Why</u>??
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
Oh sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
I want him to have every chance Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months.
Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.
Honey I have to clarify this. The thing is Dr. Edelstein my brother has an absolute <u>horror</u> of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today tomorrow a month from now...
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
At the moment yes.
But these...machines are what's keeping him alive is that right?
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.
Yeah I was thinking...I mean I'm a celebrity now do I really want to get married? But on the other hand if you're married they can't testify against you.
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing in public at a benefit.
Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as they break that pińata we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
You're really gonna pop the question?
And last...you remember Bill here from the Bazoom Toy Company? He's got a little something I think you'll like.
I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
Well nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.
How much?
Oh here's something. The city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit.
Less.
I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
What's the matter?
A pińata. That's a <u>great</u> idea!
So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big pińata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - <u>hundreds</u> of 'em.
...In some weird way I respect that.
My life was totally crappy Herb and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
Oh my God...you're proposing?
I got the ring. <i></i> Tonight's the night Herb. Tonight's the night.
Why?
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
Herb it's too much. It's all out of hand.
Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God -
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
Go? There's a potload of money here pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
Julie and I - we were just gonna go...
Sorry Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I know you don't like the idea but you really ought to talk to these guys -
Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!
What'll it do if they pull the plug?
You know Julie even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain.
I don't want to <u>stop</u> the nightmare Hutch. I want to crank it up. I want to take it right off the charts. I want to <u>scare him awake</u>.
That's not going to stop his nightmare -
No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
Holy shit.
Oh no no no. Y'see Stu as it happens that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice!
You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
Nobody wants to be a sidekick Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
Monkeybone...!?
The monkey of course. It was his idea.
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
It's simple Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
Easy pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off and that musta been what 25 years ago...?
YOU SET ME UP!!
Sorry Steve maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?
Sorry Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got <u>big plans</u> for that body of yours!
NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY -
Kid listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me.
Land of Death. How do I get there?
Hyp I'll do anything.
Oh right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well actually two. Actually no there was that other guy who...well <u>very few people</u> have done it.
Guys I don't mean to be rude but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...
Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book Stick-Up-the-Ass My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity you get pretty damned tired of <u>that</u> schtick. <i></i> So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park with a buncha animals to run it. I'm supposed to be <u>grateful</u>?
You're Death's <u>brother</u>?
Now Death is not what you would call a people person like me. Death is a <u>putz</u> - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
Me? <u>Me</u> go crawling to Death? My friend it will be a cold cold day in Las Vegas Nevada before I go crawling to <u>that</u> piece of -
Maybe you could talk to Death!
Stu I like you personally I admire your work but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
Nine AM! But that's - <u>twelve hours</u>.
Actually Stu Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
Besides Julie wouldn't...she'd never...
Y'see Stu as I understand it you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken or don't I get to... Is there some...
Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
Tell me what?
Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?
Well I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm <u>okay</u>. Until I can get out of here...
Uh huh. And?
Mr. Hypnos I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
Wait a minute. Stu Miley right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> This is an <u>honor</u>. We see a lot of nightmares down here but yours are like <u>caviar</u> man. You da <u>shits</u>!!
He called me "Doc."
Boy the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep call you - ?
Heirloom? Huh? You want a <u>used ring</u> - ?
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
<u>Well</u> Miss Smarty if I didn't go out I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?
You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u> Stu. - Where are your pants?
Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
Baby don't lie. I know you went out.
Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
Well baby I do but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
I had to park two blocks away. Is something -
And speaking of which here's the light of my life the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.
I need a new PR guy.
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
I'm heading in to work baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone -
Got a doctor on duty.
You sure this is...medically advisable?
Ohhh nothing.
What are you watching?
<i></i> In what way?
You're acting kind of...odd.
Sure. Why?
Stu are you...feeling okay?
Bitchin' good cake.
Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.
Meaning me of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...
Home sweet home huh? Actually I was expecting something a little swankier. How much loot does old Stu rake in anyway?
Oh baby I can't believe you're back.
My <u>tail</u> itches.
What's the matter?
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
Oh Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
It was great baby. Let's get you to the ER.
How was it? I don't recall.
Julie?... Hey you <u>are</u> a looker.
Stu?
I'd better go report this...
I'm fine baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
Are you okay??
I don't think so.
Did we just - <u>hit</u> something?
I am happy. It just so happens this is the happiest night of my life.
<i></i> If you do I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
I might wake up.
What's the "bad" part?
I'm trying. It's weird that's all. I never had any good luck until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up and everybody loves him and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
Who?
Look at this! He won't let us leave!
Yeah I <u>could</u> but the thing is if later got here sooner it would be...better.
Can't you give it to me later?
That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on Doc I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!
This is hard for me Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now and... <i></i> I gave the order.
Kimmy! What's the matter?
Give me a date Doctor.
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
Please Julie. This is not easy for me. Our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. A long time. It just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
Kimmy he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -
Grandmama's ring. The <u>engagement</u> ring. He asked me to send it to him -
The ring...
I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
I'm fine Kimmy. Fine.
An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself but I didn't know he would be like like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
When'd you get in?
Oh Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother...
Thanks Kitty I'll never forget you for th--
Go. Just <u>go</u>.
<u>I'll</u> worry about the guards. <i></i> OKAY STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.
How am I gonna get past the guards?
You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
Don't ask where I got it.
Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place and only thinking of her.
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is my girlfriend is now living with and possibly engaged to a demented monkey.
I'm so sorry Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really really liked you.
Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait and I wait and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
Hypnos?
Is something wrong Stu? You seem so tense.
Nothing for him! He's being repressed.
Don't joke around little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
Awwww. Worried about my feelings are you? Well there's a new twist.
You've been a hell of a figment pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me.
Oh don't you worry. I'll be fine.
It's just...now that I'm leaving I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
You saved my life Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
Isn't that Lulu?
What?
Stu...LOOK!
There's a thing here! There's a switch!
IT'S NOT WORKING.
Stu...Stu...
I don't <u>know</u>.
Where'd he go??
Oh <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
He's taking her to the land of Death right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
OH THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very very wrong here.
All right. You can come.
You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on your own. I mean a guy's gotta have a <u>sidekick</u>. For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter - <i></i> It's the land of Death Stu the Land of Death! Don't go in there without your comedy relief!!
No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
<i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.
Stu you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. ­- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
Fate worse than death! Well it's been real boss but I gotta go buff up my resumé. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
Mr. Hypnos you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do.
I'm so dumb! I <u>deserve</u> to die -
Well - yeah - but that doesn't...<u>apply</u>. It was different then. I was <u>depressed</u>. My life is great now. I'm in love!
Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??
Mr. Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you -
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
How'd <u>you</u> get in there?
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin you little...<u>doodle</u>.
Y'call that art? Why my three-year-old can paint better than that.
Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
<i></i> HEY!! HEY YOU!!
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
Sorry Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
The sidekicks' union! Me Tonto and Robin the Boy Wonder. You top bananas better <u>watch your</u> <u>ass</u>!
<u>What</u> union?
I'm reportin' this to my union!!
FORGET IT! NO WAY! I'M NOT GETTING -
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
Come on pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!
<i></i> I'm sorry Kitty - what were you saying?
My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before.
I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
Aaah it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my <u>species</u>.
You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town under five minutes and in a coma don't <u>count</u>.
I am not. And I don't gotta.
Aw come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
I doubt that. Besides I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
<u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
Get on! Anastasia get on!
Hurry Grandmama!
When you're older . . .
"Together in Paris"! Oh when can we be "together in Paris?!
It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
Oh Grandmama why do you have to go back to Paris?
I know but I had to because . . .
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
How to read.
What were you showing her?
I was showing Sonya something . . .
Why were you so late tonight
Then come find me.
Anya! What if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
I have to go now before it gets light.
I'm not sure but look. . .
Where is your home Anya?
No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
Are you running away?
No. From now on I am your loyal subject ... your highness. By your leave?
Vlad stop acting this way! You're my friend!
Fortunately I am to be married.  With your highness permission.
Cut it out Vlad! I'm not angry with you anymore - I know how much you needed the money.
Yes your highness.
Poor Meetoo!
Yes your highness.
Oh Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh Vlad - look at him!
Not you. Him.
I shant!
You'll laugh.
Come out! I can do alterations.
No! I look ridiculous!
You must have.
Did I tell you that?
I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess!  Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
We're just going to refresh your memory...
Ah ... the Lady Sophie... The ravishing first cousin once removed from the Empress. We must convince Sophie that you are the Princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the Empress ... your grandmother I mean.
Who's Sophie?
We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.
I'm fine.
Is everyone all right?
She's quite right Dmitri a man of my stature should not have to
Noooo....
Look I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
Good day!
Well I don't have any money . . .
Providing travel papers is illeagal!  I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.  Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
Who did you hear it from?
I'll never let go!
Don't let me go!
Anya... where are we?
Dmitri?
I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a lie!
No! Well yes but
Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
Anya wait!
Don't be
I'm so scared...
You'll convince her. You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know.
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
Nervous?
It's okay. Didn't hurt..
Oh! I'm sorry...
Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!
I'm sorry.
Well the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much but what I did have -- I lost.
I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
Yeah ... well yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess do you?
Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
Sad?
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
It's not you - it's the dress!
You said you wouldn't laugh!
It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.
What a beautiful ship!
The dessert fork!
It's the best fork of all
...fish fork salad fork meat fork and. . .  [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
Every Russian family has one..
You are the Princess.
You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!
You shouldn't have pushed us!
You must enjoy causing me pain!
No!
Come on!
HUH?!
Now just get off the train.
Forged papers! Now what?!
Trying... to... breathe...
Just what do you think you're doing?!
Why?
Come on up!
That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
I'm going to stretch my legs
I was all out of dynamite!
By pulling my hair?!
I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up!
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but come on. . .  Look at me!
You never thought of the possibility?
Anastasia's grandmother is in Paris.  We're going to bring Anastasia to her - in Paris. 
I have my reasons.
Why do you want to go to Paris?
Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
You know it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
What happened to your parents?
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
Who are you?!
AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER.
That's quite a hard head you've got there boy.
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
Ouch!  That really hurt!
And we have found each other nothing will ever change that! I am your family dear child but I may not be your home.
I've spent my whole life waiting to find you ...
Yes you do. You do.
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
And this is my future. This is who I am!
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart in the future that you make for yourself.
I wanted to come home Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
Is it? Is this what you want?
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
You'll have to become used to it child if you accept the crown...
Why does everyone have to act that way?
No he just wanted to know you were happy.
Dmitri didn't want the money?
No not about the ceremony Anastasia - do you understand the choice you must make.
Oh yes Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
Don't you child?
No no child... shush... it's all right ...
No it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him I think...
Anastasia! It was just a bat! It's gone dear...
Don't worry about that now child it will all come back to you now that you're home...
... and that Christmas dinner when Cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! I do remember so much now Grandmama - but not everything.
THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
PAR AWAY LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
I remember something lost ... I'm so confused! Oh please just tell me if you recognize me! Do you think I could have... belonged to you ...
Do you remember this?
I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
Who are you child?
Shut up!
PARSE HOLDS THE KEY TO MY HEART FRENCH- BAT- CHICKS HANG OUT AT MONTMARTRE WE'LL EAT SOME IN-SECTS THEN GO BACK AND HAVE --
Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?
She leads a charmed life that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child on the train and now ... it's him.
Boy don't you hate it when that happens?
What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
Bartok... a question.
I'm getting a chest cold..
Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick you know that.
Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her.
Evil powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them control them. If they should all be released at once... well ...
You'd lose your security deposit?
Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
My Aunt Bella sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up anyway she always said "Curses were made to be broken". Course she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks so it wasn't quite so profound...
I cursed then all!
Hey she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight outta mind outta Russia.
How do you know?
Trust me it's her!
Okay... you're not gonna like this but well it looks like Anastasia is ... still alive.
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
So I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk you know but I mean the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.  Someone's gotta clean that up...
Why would I ever be angry with you little friend?
No I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay now... promise you won't get angry.
I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
And what do you want my little rat-with-wings?
Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
What?
She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
So where will you go?
Watch me.
But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!
Dmitri ... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner.
What do you mean?
Life is funny isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
Are you feeling all right?
We did it! We did it my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!
It worked in Odessa...
The "Odessa Dunk"?
If I used the word "bleak" I would be optimistic.
How is our current financial status?
Ah! Let us begin!
See? The Princess is under there ...
Pray he's color-blind...
What do we do now?
Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
Well she certainly has a mind of her own.
Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
You're a princess...
What a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'Your Highness".
"Wake up your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
Wake up young lady that's our train.
Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
Hurry up with those papers.
Ew. . .  the honest type.
She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .
Look!
He's her?
It's her.
That was your dinner!  I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
What was that?
We will.  We <u>have</u> to.  Come on Vlad - she's out there.
It's no use Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!
Run Anya -  go...
I'll show you!
STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others now I have to finish up with that nuisance Anastasia...
What do you want?!
I know I know ... you thought I was dead. That's how the history books will remember me - not as the ruler of all of Russia which I SHOULD HAVE BEEN - but as the guy who was never dead when you expected him to be.
Rasputin!
So. You don't want to go to the coronation eh?
Oh Dmitri.I wish that I could.
And tell me that she's happy.
She does.
Promise me she'll have her home.
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives weren't you?  Please is there nothing I can do to repay you?
I should go
You are the boy ...
Empress no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...
I want you to have the reward money - you've earned it.
No. Empress you --
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
You! How dare you?! Stop this car immediately!
I'm not Ulo and I won't slow down. But you will listen to me!
Remove him at once.
Please if you'd just listen...
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL MEEEEEE ! ! !
I did no such thing!
You gave the orders!
I had nothing to do with it!
Despite being shot poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
Rasputin!  You're alive . . .
Oh heavens no... but ...  She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.
Perhaps you could convince her?
Oh heavens I must say... no no actually I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
Then you'll take her to see Tatiana?
Oh heavens - I must say yes.
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
Who cares Z.  All I know is we gotta dig.  We're not the ones in charge.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
Break's over.
Thank goodness.  Breaktime.
No Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u> alright?  You're a good ant Z even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off before you get in trouble.
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
Z old pal...  SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
Sorry Azteca.  Here you go fellas! Fresh dirt!  Alley oop!  Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I mean this dirt is very...dirty. Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?  Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm seeing double.  It looks like there's <u>two</u> million ants in here.  When's lunch?  Tomorrow or the day after?
Right...because every ant's important!
Someone who follows his heart!
No -- an <u>individual</u>!
Invisible!
Well because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it Azteca...
That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
You know you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z!  He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
Z?  <u>Our</u> Z?  The little guy made it!
Wait a minute that's no soldier -- that's Z!
I'll make myself available...Listen better watch out with the backtalk.  I don't know want you to end up like the guy who used to work next to me.  I'm afraid he got... <u>downsized</u>.
No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
Are you asking me out to dinner?
Sorry I got you in trouble.  But listen you can share my rations.
I don't know what came over me talking back like that.  I must be going crazy...
Mmm yes I see what you mean...
Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt you move it you pick it up again you move it again -- lots of repetitions you exercise the forceps and the pincers --
Tell me about it.
I'm new...I was born yesterday.
Hey slow it down big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad...How come I haven't seen you around here before?
Because...because he's <u>twice</u> the ant that you are.  I could <u>never</u> go through with marrying you.  I'm -- I'm an <u>individual</u> and when I get married it'll be to someone <u>I</u> choose.
You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing in common...
Well...  I declared war!
So um...how was your day?  What did you do?
Very well.  Carpenter is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
General -- we have to talk sometime!
A <u>few</u>?
I mean I've got the whole package right?  A great life a beautiful wife and a few kids.
I know it's crazy but -- I can't just leave.  Don't argue with me.  If I've learned anything it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  Or beans.  Something like that.  Anyway I've <u>got to warn the others</u>.
Z!  what are you doing?
Oh no...
Bala that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- Formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  That's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
There's something going on Z --
Why do they have you tied up here?
Well I...I know it's a little strange but...I thought it might come in handy if I...needed a scarf someday.  Well to be honest I just liked having it.
You held onto this all that time?
Sorry it's been through a war not to mention everything else...
Well "trouble" is my middle name. Actually my  middle name is .985 but I don't tell people.  Hey Bala I...I actually have something of yours...you left it at the bar that night.
Just looking for fun adventure trouble I guess.
So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
Forget it.  You go ahead I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".
Come on Z.
<u>This is all your fault</u>!!!
Yes?
Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....
Let's dig in!
You were right...you were right!  Z it's <u>beautiful</u>!
We've found it!  <u>Insectopia</u>!  Look at all this food'
What difference does it make...we're both going to starve to death or get squished or set on fire...
Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
Face it Z we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...
Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
So what makes you so special?
Well...no but --
And only you can become a Queen?
Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
Princess has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
Stop fooling around in there.
Hlllllllp!
Out here I'm just what?
Listen "Princess" you can't order me around.  Out here you're not the boss anymore -- out here you're just --
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
Wait I hear something!
Want a list?
Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?
Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?
We're going to die!
<u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  Look I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright I was miserable but I was <u>happily miserable</u>.
My skin's dry my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you you ruined my life.
Water...water -- oh you already said that.
Water...water...
That's not a name!  That's just a letter!
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
Worker!  Come back here now!
Yeah well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker that's just a fairy tale!
Well that's an appealing offer but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me I'm going to Insectopia.
Now worker you shall take me back to the colony and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
I <u>didn't</u> choose him.  What kind  of <u>idiot</u> would...  ...<u>choose</u> who she wanted to marry?
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Oh come on <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy earthy sensual worker!
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
Well I guess that makes us even.
I -- <u>hate</u> -- you.
Look around sweetheart.
No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
Theoretically yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess!
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
Climb up that tree and get a better view!
Excuse me I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
Alright alright I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
I order you to find out where we are!
How should <u>I know</u>?
What <u>was</u> that thing?
SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!
-- At the <u>worker bar</u>!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
Quiet -- sshhh!!
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
Gee uh could you say it a little louder I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
OH MY GOD IT'S YOU!  YOU'RE A WORKER!!!  A filthy stupid disgusting WORKER!
No...as a matter of fact...
He was a worker.  I danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. I'm not shocking you am I?
No weirdly...You remind me of someone...
Divinely?
You dance...
Uh sorry General I...I've always had this animal magnetism it --
No General.  I'm dancing with the war hero.
Oh...oh well then one more won't matter.
Yes.
Ah yes.  Well charmed I'm sure.  So Princess have you ever danced with a hero?
I'm Princess Bala.
And you are...?
Well if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero yes I am.
You're the hero of the recent termite campaign aren't you?
Let me think.  Hmmnn...  Never.  Bye!
Wait!  When can I see you again?
Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!
Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?
Oh that's okay I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
You watch yours soldier or my worker friend will beat you up!
Why can't I just do whatever I want to do?  Why can't I just go wild?! Yahoo!
You -- you think I'm right?
You're right!
Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
Really?
Well actually uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
Are you sure this is a real dance?
<u>What</u>?
The palace hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little you know from inbreeding --
I work in the palace I don't get out much.
So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
Wanna dance?
What a bunch of losers.  Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --
Then if I go to the worker bar it isn't improper.  Anyway don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.
Of course not --
And do Princesses do improper things?
Of course --
I'm the Princess aren't I?
We shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!
The worker bar!  Yes!  That's where I want to go!
There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  I want to try someplace different.
Mom!
Bala!
Darling you must encourage the troops -- wave!
Who is that idiot?
Yes...he's wonderful...
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
You did?
I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
It's just that -- well I'm honored that you selected me and everything I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
Bala has always been a hopeless romantic General.
Don't make my mistake kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
Barbatus hang on -- Barbatus!!
I wonder...what...was it all...for...
Hang in there buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright Z.  In this ant's army a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
No no you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
Be honest kid -- am I hurt bad?
Barbatus!
Barbatus?
Z!  Over here!
Don't get all sappy about it!
BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!
Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.
Don't be scared kid.  Barbatus's got yer back.
Superior numbers kid!
So we're going back for more armor right?  I mean these guys are from outer space how are we supposed to beat them?!
Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle!
Well what exactly does our platoon do?  Serve beverages?  Process paperwork?
Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact she's playing completely unattainable.  So what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter kid?  Leave a girl behind?
Trial membership?  Kid when you join this ant's army you're in for the full hitch.
I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
You new kid?
Uh actually we <u>are</u> outnumbered sir...
What are you doing?!  ATTACK!!  Come on you yellow-bellies!  Don't just stand there Carpenter! Make an example of yourself!
Ant Team Six...
Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
Scattered reports sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
No one should have to.  Have him brought to me.
Well uh who notices workers sir?
Notice the big one holding hands with the female?
I've never seen anything like it General they're they're...well look!
Dammit this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
Duty calls!
Fourteen-fifty hours sir.
Outstanding.  Princess...?
Actually sir we're ahead of schedule.  We have thirty-six seconds available right now.
Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
Princess Bala sir.  Your fiancee.
No sir!
Not that one.  Or that one.
That's correct sir!
We know what makes an ant colony strong don't we?  We know that no ant can be an individual.  No <u>single</u> ant matters right?
Okay son.
I...I have no idea sir.
So tell me.  Where's Z?
Thank you sir.
Good.  You're a good soldier.
Oh no sir!
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality have you?
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know really sir.
So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
ARREST HIM!
Well it wasn't a masquerade really it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
What's this?  A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!
Oh of course --
May I cut in?
Oh hey that's great I think I see an old war buddy over there it's been fun chatting.  Good luck with the hallucinations.
I tell you son sometimes at night I see myself in battle fighting a horrible faceless enemy with the future of our whole species at stake. And always the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
Well I I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there and fight and bleed and die for the colony the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
...Not enough food?
Yes and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
Wow what a spread -- you know there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
In love?  I'm just a plain old soldier at heart.  I'll tell you what I love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders...and the company of other warriors.
So...you two are in love?
Affirmative.
Engaged?  As in you're getting married?
Well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>Me</u>!
Well I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back.  So tell me fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform?
Son you're an ant after my own heart.  A warrior.  An ant that looks death right in the face and <u>laughs</u>.
ONE TO NOTHING!
Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
Damn I'm proud of you boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
No -- you -- you don't understand!
Dammit I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
Geez and I forgot my toothbrush.
Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u> we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u> and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>!
Lays it on a little thick doesn't he?  If you ask me he's one giant bore.
Alright let's move out!
Very well General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
'Fraid not your majesty.  Goodbye your majesty.
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
Your majesty I'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
They should be...  But there's something funny about that soldier.
All these parties are so marvellously <u>alike</u>.
I'll take your suggestion under advisement Princess.  In the meanwhile --
Look General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
Conversation...yes...well...  Wasn't she briefed?
Yes General Formica.  Carry on my good man!  I don't know what we would do without you.
I do not recollect your majesty. Will that be all?
No snacking between meals!  Off you go!  Now -- what were we saying?
Please don't worry your majesty. Leave the worrying to me.  As you know I'm not an ant of half- measures.  I don't pussyfoot around. This crisis is my number one priority and I promise you it's being dealt with swiftly and decisively.
Yes what else?
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
General the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special someone you love.
You see?  Being an ant is being able to say "Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless <u>you're</u> meaningless."
Right!  Ants!  Millions of creatures each with his assigned task all pulling together!
...Ants...
What do you see out there?
I'm glad you asked me that question!
Why are we so successful?
Ask me why we're so successful.
YES!!!  You know people ask me "Doctor why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?
...I should?
Terrific!  You <u>should</u> feel insignificant!
I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've got abandonment issues.  My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings it's difficult to get attention.  I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight.  Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker.  But I don't have any other options.  I was assigned to trade school when I was just a <u>grub</u>.  The whole system just...makes me feel...<u>insignificant</u>.
You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
Yeah but I hate drowning more!  Now <u>dig</u>!
Don't tell anyone you're a worker. Follow that column over there.  And come right back after the inspection!
What do I do?
Yeah I know.
You're a real buddy.
Wear this.
Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know Z I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
I can't think of any.
You have to help me.  Please Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  Love is rekindled and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again and go march around to your heart's content!
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
Get real Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
Well you just sit here and be a party-pooper.
I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work they follow orders.
Time to cut a rug Z!
Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
Hey did you hear what he said?!
Weaver I'm an insect not a liquid.
And all the time I've known you you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
Z we've known each other a long time right?
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me.  Don't you want your aphid beer?
Weaver they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging.  No I'll probably never meet the girl for me.
Yeah but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world meet interesting insects and kill them.
I don't know what you're talking about Z.
Did you see that?  How he gave <u>you</u> the beers not me?  I'm telling you he's got something against workers.
I'll be back.
We declared war again?  Are you scared?
Right.  Sure.  And "Peace on earth good will toward men."
Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas Mr. Wayne.
Yes I suppose that we did.
I guess this mean we won.
You'll never guess.
Ah.  "Who" may I ask are you going "as"?
I'm tempted but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
I think I'll take the stairs.
"Affair" ... yes maybe ... if she ...
Selina ... more facets than Vicki huh?  Funny but sort of mysterious...
Alright thanks.
I will relay the message.
A "he-man"?  Sure.  They shine that beacon in the sky then wonder what hole I crawl out of.
Good joke.  Wanna hear another one?
Hanging on every word.
As I was saying:  I'm a woman and can't be taken for granted.  Are you listening you Batman you?
I'm -- sorry I --
How could you?  I'm a woman...
"Shreck's."  You --
Where's the fire?
Maybe you're right.
I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak and you have to wear a mask!
Things change.
Ah the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win playing it your way ..?
What're you really after?
Better than you know Bat-boy.
Once you were their freak now these clowns do your bidding. Must feel pretty good.
Things change.  Hey good to meet you.  We'll be working hand in glove in Gotham's glorious future.
You're not the Mayor.
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
Admiring your handiwork?
I don't know.  Till we figure it out let's ... let's keep dancing.
... What do we do?
But a kiss can be even deadlier if you mean ... it.
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it ...
I don't know anymore Bruce ...
Jesus Selina you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... I mean just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
Now don't give me a killing-Max- won't-solve-anything speech because it will.  Aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  When he should be six feet under?
You first.
Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
Y'mean take off our costumes?
There's a big comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
No hard feelings?
'S'okay I had to go home feed my cat.
Sorry about yesterday ... Some big deal came together no fell through and --
What're you doing three dates from now?
Nor I on the second.
I ah ... never fool around on the first date.
Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.
It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited.
If I said yes then you might think me a Norman Bates or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
Sure.
Photojournalist.
"Vicki."  Ice-skater or stewardess?
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
And the truth frightened her?
Nope I told her everything.
What went wrong?  Hang on I think I know ... You kept things from her.
Had one.  Didn't work.
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome I'd suppose.
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
Yes and no...
... and me.  No that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
"We"?  You and...
... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.
Yeah?  Me too...
Well I'm... braver at night if that's what you mean...
No darker than yours Bruce.
You've got a dark side Selina Kyle.
I detest violence but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer too.
You almost sound enthusiastic.
-- and it's gonna be a hot time in the cold town tonight.
I wouldn't be caught dead.  No it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
You're not coming to that are you?  "The Relighting of the Tree" thing?
I heard on TV "Catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds."  How do these hacks <u>sleep</u> at night?
And it's not even accurate ... I mean "Batman Blows It"?  The guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.
The news these days ... weird. People looking to superheroes for their peace of mind and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves or their spouses at least.
Treat to be here.
I don't see how ... Anyway it's a treat to find you out in the world away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
Scare me?  No actually I was just scaring myself ...
Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to --
Oh.  "Kyle."
I ah ... didn't catch your last name.
Pouring myself into my work.
I'm tempted.
I'm listed.
Well I could ... free up some time...
Well that's a ... long story ...
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
Yes and no ...
Didn't I say that?
You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.
Have we?
We've met.
Yawn.
It does to me.
I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
Yes did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
What happened?
Wayne I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  If my assistant were here she'd already have escorted you out to --
"Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
Scared of Oswald are you?  Why if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies at prep school!
Not compared to that "Cobblepot" person you're promoting...
I'm not scared of you Max.
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
Max I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
If my life has had any meaning that's the meaning.
Good time too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
I'd offer you coffee but my assistant is using her vacation time.
Weird huh?
No.  No glass on the inside.
Damn those Carny bolsheviks the other night throwing bricks at my windows --
Hmm.  Primitive ventilation.
One way to find out?
You killed me Batman killed me Penguin killed me.  Three lives down.  Got enough bullets to finish me off?
Was.
He <u>is</u> Batman you moron.
Selina!  Selina Kyle!?  You're fired!  And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?
Either you've caught a cold or you're planning to kill me.
Sorry Max.  A die for a die.
Let's make a deal.  <u>Other</u> than my blood what can I off--
A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
Your blood Max.
I don't know what you want but I know I can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.  Money jewels a very big ball of string...
The name is Oswald Cobblepot.
Me domesticated?  By you?  I doubt it!  You repulsive... awful... <u>penguin</u>.
Did I?  Only 'cause my mom trained me to with a man... any man all men --  Corn dog!
I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
Let's consummate our fiendish union!
I want in.  The thought of busting Batman makes me feel all ... dirty.  Maybe I'll give myself a bath right here ...
Well a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one involving the loss of innocent life ...
He napalmed my arm.  He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
You're off the hook Ozzie.  But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
Thanks.  Jeez.  Not used to this man-woman cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me I tell 'em take a number.
You're quick.  Mayor Cobblepot.
Y'mean frame him?
He'd have more power as a martyr. No to destroy Batman we must first turn him into what he hates most.  Meaning us.
We're gonna disassemble his spiffy old Batmobile then reassemble it as an H-bomb on wheels.  Capiche? Yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor.
Oh him again.  He's already history -- check it out.
I have but one pet cause today: Ban The Bat.
Are you perchance a registered voter?  I'm also a mayoral prospect.
Huh?  You're implying I'm some kinda psycho criminal?
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides the fly in our ointment.
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
Down Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!
Women... nothing surprises me Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald please.
You buy this "blurry" business?
PMS.
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
She jumped.  She'd been depressed.
I ... it was terrible I leaned over and accidentally knocked her out --
Dad!  Save yourself!
Son!
My lips are sealed.
But who could've ... no don't say it.
Well um... funny thing your penguins... they're not responding to the launch command.  Fact they're kind of turned around now... Like someone jammed our signal...
All is shrill all is blight...
Silent night violent night...
... eight seven...
The Christmas Eve of Destruction -- !
Ten nine...
Okay you have a point.  Plus the hysterics are getting on my nerves.
I'm the one you want!  Penguin please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max not Chip whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
I don't.  So no.
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling you'll take me instead.
You're coming with me you Great White Dope!  To die way down in the sewer!
I think you'd feel out of place at my party.  You see it's for winners.
Max!  Relax!  Josh and Jen'll put a spin on this.  We'll talk it over tonight at your costume par--
Point is listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you the icon of the future.  If it works don't fix it...
He didn't even lose a limb an eyeball ... bladder control ..
Imagine:  You'll have the ear of the media.  Access to captains of industry.  Unlimited poon- tang ...
Reclaim my birthright y'mean?
Sidetracked?  Oswald this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
I got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  It's crucial I not get sidetracked with some silly ...
... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot pillage annoy people in a big way ...  <u>Sounds</u> fun.  But I ...
Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
"You're doin' great Mayor Cobblepot."  "Your table is ready Mayor Cobblepot."  "I need you Oswald.  I need you now.  That's the biggest parasol I ever --"
That's fine Oswald.  But to get the Mayor recalled we still need a catalyst a trigger an incident. Like the Reichstag fire the Gulf of Tonkin.
A platform?  Lemme see ... Stop global warming.  Start global cooling.  Make the world a colder place.  <u>Frigid</u> ...
Oswald:  We need one more thing.
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
We need signatures.  To overturn the ballot.  I can supply those Oswald.
Wonder if it's worth my time.
Max elections happen in November. Is this not late December or have I inhaled too much swamp gas in my time?
Yes adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it Mr. Cobblepot you've got the magic!
Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
Don't look Oswald.  It's a surprise.
You won't regret this Mr. Shreck.
You know what Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  And once we're both back home perhaps we can help each other out ...
Fred.  Fred?  He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation and --
A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.  By the way how's Fred Adkins your old partner?
If there were such documents -- and that is not an admission -- I would have seen to it they were shredded.
What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham?
Yawn.  That coulda come from anywhere.
And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
Most of all I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
Well it's not working.
No just give you a splitting headache.
What is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
Quiet Max.  What do you think this is a conversation?
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please don't h--
Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated resting comfortably and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
Actually I have to split.  Take a "personal day."  You don't mind? Max you're tops.
I damn well better be.  In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them --
Morning Max.  Bummer about the store.  You insured?
Uh Selina this is uh Bruce Wayne.
That's my name Maximillions. Don't wear it out babe or I'll make you buy me a new one.
Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
Actually it's a lot like that.
Okay go ahead.  Intimidate me bully me if it makes you feel big.  I mean it's not like you can just kill me.
I must protect my interests Ms. Kyle.  And Interest Number One is <u>moi</u>.
It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
Too good?
And a very very good one.
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
... Where did curiosity get the cat?
And who ... would you say this <u>to</u>?
Big giant <u>capacitor</u>.  And that instead of generating power it'll sort of be --  -- <u>sucking</u> power from Gotham City and storing it ... stockpiling it sort of?  Which unless I'm being dense is a novel approach I'd say.
Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting though a bit on the technical side I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
Why how industrious.  And how did you open protected files may I ask?
No I am.  Yes I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
Working late?  I'm touched.
Oh uh I mean uh ass-goblin...

Hey Butt-Head it's that slut from the plane!
Heh heh thanks.
They perk me right up.
Well if you find yourself getting tired take a couple of these.
Uh... No  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
Oh maybe you're lactose intolerant.
Really? I poop too much.
You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.
I'm probably going to make out with her first before we you know get down...
Oh that's nice.
Yeah heh heh. I'm gonna have money and a big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head this chick is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.

Yeah we're gonna score.
Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
Thrr...

...Two...
OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
We'll get you whatever you want.  Get that other kid. We might need him.
Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
This is Agent Flemming A.T.F.. We won't hurt you. We just want the unit. Tell us where the unit is.
Who knows?
Where are his pants?
OK nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.
Attention all units. We've got him. He's in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.
Chief look!
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
Not now Bork.
Say chief isn't that guy whose camper...I mean off in whose...
Agent Hurley...
Not on him Chief.
Bork when this is all over remind me to make you an appointment with Agent Hurley.
Chief I swear we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
Okay boys and girls our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill!
Jesus jumped-up... Bork can you imagine what would happen if they set that thing off in our nation's capital or even worse if they sold it to some damned foreigner at that conference.  Well it's not gonna happen!
D.C. Chief.
What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
Where did these guys come from?
Well I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.
We've run a sample through the National Criminal Sperm Bank and come up with two possible genetic matches for a father. 
That's better. Yes?
Oh ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.
Chief you know that guy whose camper they were whacking off in?
Deep and hard.
Cavity search...?
It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished. It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough it could break open releasing the virus.
Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands...
Well sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon a manmade virus...
Damn right. Bork we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Cut the power!
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
I see it. I don't get it.
You see what I see Bork?
Bork don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
They look like a couple of kids chief.
Well sir I didn't really think it was necessary. You see we have a picture of them from the elevator security cam. Here have a look.
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
Ah the witness?
Did you give him a full cavity search?
Chief we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
Talk ta me Bork.
Dammit!  Where's that damn unit??!!
We got nothing Chief. We tore the place apart. We can only legally hold her for another couple of hours.
Cool huh huh.  Hey Beavis that's that dude that's paying us to do his wife.
Ah'm gonna blow you both to hell!
This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
She sure does.
Uh yeah. Does she have big hooters?
One more thing. Mah wife's got this leather satchel. It's black about this big. I need ya to bring it back. It's real important. Sentimental value... Any questions so far?
Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.
She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon I'll drive you to the airport.
Whoa huh huh. Cool.
Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
That's right. I'm offering you ten grand plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
Do her? Huh huh.
Uh Butt-Head.
Well Earl said you guys were young but jeez... Oh well as long as you can get the job done. So what are your names?
Yoo-hoo! Travis and Bob Head. Whoo-hoo!
Whoa this kicks ass! Huh huh huh.
Are you guys sluts too? Huh huh huh.
Meet Sylvia. And Elloise and Sam. And Ed. And Doreen.
Uh... Head? huh huh. My first name's Butt. Huh huh huh.
This is Travis and Bob... What's your last name dear?
That's why I'm bussing it across America. I'm so glad you're here.  Jim I want you to meet two nice boys.
Cool huh huh huh.
It's so nice to meet young men who are so well mannered.
Cool. Huh huh huh.
Hey you wanna see something really cool? Huh huh huh.
Uh do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
Shut up dumb-ass! You didn't score. I scored with both of them...
Yeah they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
You scored with two chicks?!
Well then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
Really? That's where we're from.
Yup. Huh huh.
You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
Uh my butt and your...uh butt.
Uh hey. One of you kids got a match?
Uh you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No way.
Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
Uh ten uh...
Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
Uh huh huh this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
Who sent ya?
Uh huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
You got two seconds!
And code the signal to my private chamber.
Yes My Lord.
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
Yes he commands you make contact with him ....
The Emperor?
It was .... the Emperor ....
Yes My Lord.  We'll find them.
Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again Admiral I've had quite enough!
Lord Vader our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
Yes Admiral .... soon.
Soon Lord Vader.
Asteroids don't concern me Admiral. I want that ship not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
Come in Admiral.
My lord.
No ... there is another.
The boy is our last hope.
Told you I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse.
Strong is Vader.  Clouded is your fate.  Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything everything!  It can save you.
Luke use The Force only for knowledge and for defense not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
You are the last Jedi Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.
Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.
We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
Will he finish what he begins?
He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
He'll learn.
This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon to the sky to the future.  Never his mind on where he was on what he was doing.  Adventure excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!
He can do it.
We've discussed this before.
Much anger in him like in his father.
He will learn patience.
Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with The Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor. If you end your training now if you choose the quick and easy path ... as Vader did ... you will become an agent of evil ... and the galaxy will be plunged deeper into the abyss of hate despair and pain that you feel your friends suffering now.
You won't.
Luke I will not lose you to the Emperor as I lost Vader.
And that is why I must go.
Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
But you cannot control it.  This is a dangerous time for you Luke. You are now most susceptible to the temptations of the dark side.
I feel The Force.
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
I can help them!
You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
But Han and Leia will surely die.
... Luke you must not go.
Luke ... you are the only hope.
Ben ... Ben ...
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda the Jedi Master.
I'm cold ... so cold ...
You must survive Luke.
You must.  Luke look at me!
I can't ...
We're not out of this yet.
Howls.
Okay okay.
Turns on Lando the newcomer with an ominous growl.
Barks an argument and shakes his head.
Three patrol ships are heading our way.
What's wrong with him?
Barks a blue streak.
Everyone's invited of course.
Barks at the mention of food. Licks his lips.
Right.
Growls a reserved greeting.
How you doing Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown eh?
I'm sure I'll see you again too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.
Barks a doleful farewell.
No I'm alright.  I'm alright.
Barks his concern.
Not now Chewie.  Lando aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?
Barks at Han.
Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?
Howls and shrugs his shoulders.
That was a long time ago.  I'm sure he's forgotten all about it and so should you.
Barks and growls at his boss.
Well it's been awhile.
Barks his agreement.
Okay Chewie it's now or never.
Chewie head for the bottom of the city.
Barks his consternation.
Howls.
... the power?
Barks his Ňright on!Ó
I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
Barks his agreement.
We should have stayed and finished them off.
What happened?
Barks at his master.
How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Can't we get on with this already?
Oh your father ... a powerful Jedi was he powerful Jedi.
Because of my father I guess.
Not far not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
It's the Jedi's time to eat too.
Look it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
Patience.  It's time to eat.
... I told you I'm not hungry.
Of course yes.  But now eat we must.  Good food I have good food.  Come come.
You know the Jedi Master?
Oh a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek Yoda.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
No no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
Okay Artoo let him have it. Now get out of here little fellow we've got things to do.
Mine mine.
Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.
I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it in this slimy mudhole.
Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
Give me that!
Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?
Listen friend we didn't mean to land here and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would but I can't.  So ...
A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.
I'm looking for a great warrior.
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
Yeah ...
Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
I'm looking for someone.
Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
... Like we're being watched.
Then I'll see you in Hell.
The night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it.
The temperature is dropping too fast.
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.
Probably isn't good enough Sergeant. Check on it!
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
Sergeant is Commander Skywalker back yet?
Yes sir!
He will join us or die My Master.
Yes ... yes.  That would be a great asset.
But if he could be turned he would be a powerful ally.
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
He's not a Jedi he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
Our destruction?  Who?
Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
I have felt it.
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
What is thy bidding My Master?
Fine.  But they'll have to take care of themselves.
Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.
Whatever it is it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look.  Come on Chewie.
I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again may the force be with you.
Thank you General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt I'm a walking dead man.
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
That's right.
The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
With all the meteor activity in this system it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
Good and Commander Skywalker?
There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set so you'll know if anyone comes calling.
Captain Solo.  What's the situation?
Good.  Soon as we're clear we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
I can see the edge of the asteroid field sir.
Not collapsing honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
We're doomed.  Goodbye Mistress Leia.  Goodbye Captain ...
I'm going to see what it is.
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
I must admit there are times I don't understand human behavior.
You too golden rod.
Sir I'm almost afraid to ask but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
What are you so grouchy about?
We're in trouble!
If I may say so Sir I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
I think we're in trouble.
It can wait.
Sit down and shut up!
Sir I was wondering ...
The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
The kid ran into something mean and it wasn't the cold.
I do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  I would hate to see Master Luke develop a short circuit ...
He doesn't make sense to me either Chewie.
Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
I don't know Artoo.  Sir might I inquire what's going on?
She is looking for Master Luke and assumed he would be here with you.  No one seems to know ...
I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator but either you have it turned off or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged Artoo could fix it if you like.
What is it?
Captain Solo sir. Might I have a word with you?
... just remember that Ôcause I'll be back ...
... I love you.  I couldn't tell you before but it's true.
Me either.  They had me howling on the scan grid but they never asked me any questions.
I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
I was worried about you.
Look sweetheart I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
No thanks.
Chewie do you think you can repair him?
Well I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming but I don't trust him.
He found him in a junk pile ...
Luke!  I'm sure he's fine.  Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
I hope Luke made it to the fleet all right.
Huh?  Oh.  Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him.  Come over here.  I want to check this out.
Has Threepio turned up yet?
You look great.
You look silly.
Who's staring?
What are you staring at?
It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
I don't like this.
Let Ôer go Chewie.
You do have your moments ... Not many but you do have them.
No.  But he has no love for the Empire that much I know ...
Can you trust him?
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
A mining colony.
Lando's not a system he's a man. A gambler con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here but reachable.
Never heard of that system.
Well sometimes ... Ah-hah I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
You keep logs?  My how organized.
Funny I have the feeling I've been in this area before.  Let me check my logs.
Here ... near the Anoat system.
That depends.  Where are we?
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
Not bad hot shot not bad.  Then what?
The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
What'd you have in mind for your next move?
Chewie check the manual release on the landing claws.
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
Oh so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
You could have warned him before you shut him off.
You're going to attack them?!!!
Sharp bank Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me turn around!  Full power on the front shield.
It's not my fault.  I can't under- stand it!
No lightspeed?
Couldn't be I checked the transfer circuits just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.
The entrance is collapsing!
I see it Chewie hang on.
But the tremors have stopped.
Strap yourself in sweetheart we're taking off!
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
Looks like some kind of Mynock.
Look we just got this bucket going again.  I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...
Are you crazy!
Outside in the cave.
Where?
There's something out there!
Try and control this ...
I do not!
You mean a man you can control.
There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
Sure they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is it gets a little dull.
Don't count on it.  I happen to like nice men.
Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
What are you afraid of?
Why?
Stop that.
That's quite a compliment.
Sometimes maybe ... occasionally when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
You could be a touch warmer though.  Admit it against your better judgment you think I'm all right.
Yes you do.
Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
Would you please stop calling me that?
Easy your worship.  Only trying to help.
Where have I heard that before?
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
They're moving away.
Felt like a hydro concussion ... an Imperial Cruiser.
That was no earthquake.
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
I don't expect anything except to be left alone.
Well I hope you don't expect more.
Sorry Captain being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
Beautiful.
How do I look?
You don't look angry.
Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
Why Princess this is so sudden.
That should do nicely.
What is it?
There there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
Right.  I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...
Now you're making sense.
We've got to get out of this shower.
I'm against that.
But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
Good.
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
I take it back.
Well you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
Aren't I?  Hang on sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
Probably an asteroid field ....
Asteroids!  Chewie bank left let's find out where they're coming from ...
Or you ran into something ....
That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
I'm glad you said there was going to be no problem or I'd be worried.
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
I know I know I see them ... LEIA See what?
I'll be surprised if we ever start moving.
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
Don't worry your holiness I'll get her started.
Would it help if I got out and pushed?
Wait don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
Hey!  Someone's still in here.
Who's scruffy-looking?  I tell ya' sweetheart I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  Doesn't it look that way to you Luke?
Why you low-down stuck-up half- witted scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
Come on your highness are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
You must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
Ooops!  I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet.
I don't know what he's talking about.
I had nothing to do with it.  General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.
Well your worship it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.
Now don't panic.  We don't know that.
An Imperial probe droid.
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
What was it?
.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives they could be anywhere.
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
Forget it.
Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han I don't know how ...
Sure ... If I were interested. But I don't think it'd be much fun.
And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
Spare me please!  Don't tell me about the Rebellion again.  I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion.  The result is you're as cold as this planet.
We are fighting for a cause much ...
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss.
I respect you.  You're a bold fighter maybe not the brightest but ... HAN No your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
And what are they pray tell?
You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...
Me?  I don't know what you mean.
Not you?
Yes.
We?
Han we need you here.
He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes Gank killers and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.
Does Luke know?
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
Yes Your Highness?
Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.
I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
Now don't get the wrong idea pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
About what?
That makes a good story.  But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight.
Probe?  What probe?
That's two you owe me junior.
Thanks to you.
Hi kid you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.
I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
Loud and clear kid.  What's up?
Yeah you're a real hero.
Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ...
Don't ask me but he's on his way.
All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
Luke?  I don't get it.
He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker.
You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over.
Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here but at least they'll be safe.
This ought to be good.
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
Get out of here Lando!
I'm sorry too.
Sorry friend I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
Nothing.  I never would have guessed that underneath that wild schemer I knew was a respon- sible leader and businessman ... But you wear it well.
Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?
How's your mining operation going?
I'll have my people get to work on it right away.  Hate the thought of the Millennium Falcon without her heart.
Hyperdrive.
That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
What have you done to my ship?
Repairs ...
That won't be easy my friend ... What brings you here anyway?
I'll bet.
I always said you were a gentleman.
Are you kidding?
No hard feelings?
Why you slimy double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.
I'm altering the bargain.  Pray I don't alter it any further.
That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
Take them but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
I'll take what's mine now.
I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo.
We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there it'll kill him.
Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.
No.
I forget nothing Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
What about Leia and the Wookiee?
That sounds familiar.
I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've got nothing to worry about.
Are the coordinates set?
The deflector shields are gone.
It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando open the hatch.
Someone's falling.
Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
No argument just do it.  That's a command!
Luke needs help.  We must go back.
What?
Luke!
I knew that set-up was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it.
I didn't say anything?
What'd you say?
His fate is sealed.  You'll be lucky to get out yourself.  All systems are on alert.  everything's locked.
We've got to find Luke.
Don't worry about a thing.  I'll get us going.
You'd better know what you're doing or this is going to get very messy.
What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...
Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
Very noble.  Not smart but noble.
There's not much chance but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
Chewie's right.  We must try to save Han.
This is no time to be choosy honey.  What do you say we debate this later?  There's still a chance I can get you out of here.
We have no use for your kind.
Look I stand to lose everything by this.
And when do you betray us again?
I'm coming over to your side that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
What's going on?
... we're the bait.
Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...
I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
What about Han?
Yes we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
It's a lovely outpost.
Not actually .... Our operation is small enough not to be noticed so you might say we're enterprisers. Most of our trade is well ... unofficial.
You're part of the mining guild then?
.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.
Would you care to join me for a little refreshment?
Thanks.
I must say your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
Not really.
Sorry am I interrupting anything?
You may call me Leia.
Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome I am Baron Lando Calrissian Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
What is it?
We've picked up something outside the base in zone one moving East.
Not yet.  They're working on it now.
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
Slim but yes there's a chance. They have a shelter.  It's not much but ...
Is there any chance of them surviving out there?
The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.
I understand.
Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
Let's go.
Artoo you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
I thought you knew this person.
Rather touchy aren't they.
Well what now?
Sir we've lost the rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
Oh my no!
What??
Sir it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
A tremor!
Closer?!
Closer?!
If I might remind you sir the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
You don't have to do this to impress me.
I'll be back later.
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition sir.
You rest now.
I've never seen it fail.
This hyperdrive had better work.
He'll survive.
Lando is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?
Luke no!  It's a trap.
Leia!
Snow creatures ... they're here?!
I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
Jabba the Hutt?
He wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
Calm down will ya?  Tell me about Han.
Han's leaving?
First Han now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
What are you talking about?
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure really ...
Where are you going?
What did you say?!
Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
Me too.  I was afraid.
I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well it made me think about things.
The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?
If it must be.  Yes.
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that master.
Yes yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
Foreknowledge is helpful but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  You have far to go in your training.
They're my friends.
Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away little machine!
Will they die?
It is the future you see.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
I see a city in the clouds.
Control control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy not fast.
My mind fills with so many images.
Free your mind and return he will.
Ben?  Ben?
Only what you take with you.
What's in there?
This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
I feel cold.
Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
Four this time!  The Force you feel.
No!  Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ...
But tell me why ...
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
No no.  Easier quicker more seductive.
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
The dark side beckons.  But if once start down the dark path forever will it dominate your destiny.  Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice.
Price?  What do you mean?
Anger fear aggression!  The dark side of The Force are they.  Easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight.  Beware beware beware of them.  A heavy price is paid for the power they bring.
But I feel The Force flowing!
No no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
That would matter not were The Force flowing through you.  Higher you'd jump!  Faster you'd move! Open yourself to The Force you must.
They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
That they are.
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
That is why you fail.
I don't believe it.
Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?
I can't. It's too big.
No.  Try not.  Do do.  Or do not. There is no try.
Okay.  I'll give it a try.
No!  No different!  The differences are in your mind.  Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you.
Master moving rocks is one thing but this is a little different.
Yes but by what standard ask I?  Forget your old measures. Unlearn heh unlearn.
I thought I was in good shape.
It would be in seven pieces were you a Jedi.
You will be my young one.  Heh. You will be.
I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.
You are reckless!
I have followed my feelings.
To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment the most serious mind.
Why not me?
Ready are you?  What know you of ready?  I have trained Jedi for 800 years.  My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.
Never.
There is no escape.  You must join me or die.  Don't make me destroy you here ... The Emperor is strong with The Force.  But if you join me together we could overthrow Him.  Do not resist. It is our destiny!
No! .... Never ....
The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line.  You will achieve great power ... Come join with me!  Together we will be the most powerful ... even stronger than The Emperor.
Time will tell.
All too easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as The Emperor thought.
That won't be necessary.
I'll die first.
There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come The Emperor will complete your training.
No!
Your future lies with us Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obi-wan knew this to be true.
And I too.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
The fear does not reach you.  You have learned more than I anticipated.
I want that ship.
It won't get through the blockade.
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
Seventeen ships destroyed we don't know how many got away.
Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now Admiral Piett.
Yes My Lord.
Yes Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...
The Hoth System?
No.  I feel something.
You hear something?
If the nest is upwind so are we. When he comes back he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
It certainly does.
It matches the pictures.
Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch take a look around the trophy room and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me.
You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
Sorry.  We were saying?
A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins.  If it escapes.  But there weren't enough escapes from you and me Ajay.  I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death.  Maybe I just feel too close to it my--
How do you mean?
Just a little bit too much I think.
But alone?  We always had great success together you and I.
Well I'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch.  You go.
I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica or thereabouts. If he's to be believed it's a most uh unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
Last time I plugged it in I suppose. Why?
You.  Tell me Roland when was the last time you answered your phone?
That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down sit down what brings you to Mombassa?
How did you know?
Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
Why didn't you tell us about these guys Ian?!
Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
Is there an antidote?
Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all?
It doesn't matter what I think.
You think I'm all talk Eddie?
Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
You are an academic.
Light and strong light and strong sure why not it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
"Minimal" is too much.   It has to be light it has to be strong --
Minimal.
Any damage?
Ian you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it.  I will not  be known only for my failures.  And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  You're too smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr. Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance at redemption.  For both of us. There's no time to equivocate we must seize it now before --
I'm not going John.
You'll need an animal behaviorist someone with unimpeachable credentials.  I believe you already know Sarah Harding.  She's got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter/scavengers I bet she'd be dying to prove on a scale like this.  If you convince her to go it'll be a major coup.  When she publishes the scientific community must take it seriously.
John . . .
I've been putting this together for over a year.  I have personal suggestions for your entire team phone numbers contact people.  They won't believe you about what they're going to see so don't bother trying to convince them.  Just use my checkbook to get them there. I'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts as such money and equipment as you need but only if you leave immediately.  If we hesitate all will be lost.
So what?
It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares my reputation's a joke my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?
After the accident at the park a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling now I want you to go there and document them.
No no no no no no . . .
Isla Nublar was just a showroom Ian something for the tourists Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first on Isla Sorna eight-some miles from Nublar.
I don't believe you.
The hatchery in particular?  You know my initial yields had to be low far less than one percent that's a thousand embryos for every single live birth.  Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation not the spotless little laboratory I showed you.
What are you talking about?
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
What?
You were right -- and I was wrong. There!  Did you ever think you'd hear me say that?  Spectacularly wrong. Instead of observing those animals I tried to control them.  I squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives.  Not their lives as man would have them behind electric fences but in the wild.  Behavior in their natural habitat the impossible dream of any paleontologist.  I could have had it but I let it slip away.  Thank God for Site B.
They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
When you have a lot of time to think it's funny who you remember.  It's the people who challenged you.  It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning.  I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned.
Resentful.
Everyone keep your voices down!
Are you looking for a problem?
You gotta be kidding.  You dragged me out of Greenpeace to be a corporate stooge?  You couldn't get anybody else?
But he's the head of InGen!
Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
InGen is a genetics corporation isn't it?
-humidity I know.  Highest lead density on the market.
Do you have chromium tapes?  The others fog in high-
-- my --
Oh --
We've got to see one to find out. Is there any --
That doesn't say a thing about T-rex they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas jackals nearly all species of predator birds --
I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower we need to be out in the field as close to the animals as possible.
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
Ian you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
Not without a shot of the nest.
The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment that's conclusive!
I want to see the nesting ground!
That was a pair bond!  A family group even long after that infant was nestbound!
Come on!
Dad!
I'm fine... I'm fine...
I'm fine I'm fine I was scared I thought you are you okay?!
Are you all right?!  Anything broken?
Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
What are you guys gonna do?
On the side of that one truck.
Where does it say that?
"InGen."  What's InGen?
Because you said so.  Maybe nobody else believed you but I always did.
How could you possibly?
You like to have kids you just don't want to be with them do you?
This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
I don't care about the trials I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant like I was in Austin.
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
I could come with you.
That Richard.
No.  Richard talked to his parents.
Well is he?
That was about a year ago.
You know at the bus stop.  With the hair?
Which one?
Is that kid still bothering you?
No Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
I'm your daughter all the time you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
My vacation is over in a week.
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
Well I do and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
I don't even know this woman.
Okay Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
Kelly!  What are you doing here?
Hi Dad.
Let it go Peter.  The animal won.
If I don't move I can't shoot it.
It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
It's... behind... us.
Why?
We took to the rock.
Possible.
Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
Good.
The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator so power shouldn't be a problem.
Operations building.  Far end of the street.
Where's the power and radio setup?
Piss.
What is that?
The velociraptors.
What is?
Isn't it obvious?
What in Christ's name is going on?!
We've got to transport it seven thousand miles.  Would you prefer it bit off the leg of a crew member?
You've broken its leg!
Had to.  To keep him still for the trip.
I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk but I only thought of adults it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea my little f-
What?
You're kidding yourself.  An adult T-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly.  It acts the way people wish they could that's why everyone's fascinated by it.  If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only ninety-nine percent would --
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles all the way back to its den just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
Why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill?
Forty yards.  Less maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.
How close do you have to be?
My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
What kind of gun is that?
To collect my fee.
Where do you think you're going?!
Good lad.
Okay.
Peter if you want me to run your little camping trip there are two conditions.  First -- I'm in charge and when I'm not around Dieter is.  Your job is to sign the checks tell us we're doing a good job and open your case of scotch when we have a good day.  Second condition -- my fee.  You can keep it.  All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs.  A male.  Buck only.  Why and how are my business. If you don't  like either of those conditions you're on your own.  Go ahead and set up your camp right here or in a swamp or in the middle of a rex nest for all I care.  But I've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas.  Okay?
You heard his Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
What?  Why?
Cancel that Dieter.
Piss.
What's he got in there?
InGen is my livelihood Dr. Malcolm and I will jealously defend its interests.  People will know what I want them to know when I want them to know it.
It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver it's my life.
You version of it.
I didn't tell anything I told the truth.
If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy I hardly see how I am to--
You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children.
You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw.  You violated that agreement.
Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want but I was there.
So you two were just uh telling old campfire stories were you?
I lost everything I came after on this trip but one T-rex in one theme park could single-handedly bail InGen out of Chapter 11.
You're going too?
You know how to work a radio don't you?
Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.
What?
Oh God.
Their what?
Don't start a legal argument with me this island isn't your property and neither are these animals!
Trespassing sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here did you know that?
Look!  Sarah!
Something's wrong.
DAMN IT BE SURE!!
I think she's with Sarah!
I have to find Kelly!
Head for the roof!
For sixty seconds maybe!  Look at this!  You could-
It'll hold!
This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
We're sure as hell not going back out there"
We can't stay in here!
She's with Sarah!
Where's Kelly?
Come on!
I don't know.
What are they?
No.
Lava?
No way.
No.
What do you think they want?!
What do they want?!
No!  Get in the car before they hear us!
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
It has a broken leg!
?!
Dr. Juttson please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.
There' no reason for name calling.
I don't know these guys but I know 'em.  I've seen 'em on Japanese whalers French barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic.  They're all the same. They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em sink our boats and then call us crazy.
Our chance to do what?
Then this is our chance.
You can't stay Kelly that's it. It's too dangerous.
Do you see any family resemblance here?
Oh my God.
No way.
She's nuts.
She's gutty.
Now's the perfect time.  The animal just fed so it won't stalk us for food.  Predators don't hurt when they're not hungry.
You gentlemen feel you have to do this now?
Don't let it out of your hands again.  Can the kid walk?
Four counting the one in the chamber.
How many rounds did you find for that weapon?
It's called self-testing.  But in your case it sounds more like self-destruction.  A uniquely human characteristic.  In fact human beings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that's our function. Maybe every few sons some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world clears the decks and lets evolution proceed to his next phase.  Maybe death and destruction are our job maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
You remember that guy about twenty years ago I forget his name but he climbed Everest without any oxygen came down almost dead.  And they asked him "why did you go up there to die?"  And he said "I didn't.  I went up there to live."
But why?
Somewhere on this island there exits the greatest predator that ever lived.  And the second greatest predator must take him down.
I don't care about my life.  But if I'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger --
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
It'll still exit if they go on not knowing won't it?
Because it exists.
Why should they?
So that others would know about this place?
Why did you come here?
Just -- flawed.  Very deeply flawed.
Feeling a bit blue are we?
A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real you see it everywhere -- in weather in river flooding in baseball in blackjack in stock markets.  Once things go bad they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
What's that?
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
We'd never make it past the raptors. Trust me I have some experience in this matter.
Look we have two choices.  We can hike back down to the lagoon where we can sit for two days in the open next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive or we can head for the village where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.
No.  I'm quite certain you can't.
Birdshit?
These formations.  They're dried --
What?
Ian.  It's guano.
Ian they will misplace our evidence shoot holes in our testimony and say some special effects genius created the animals.  The only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a T-rex in the middle of times Square.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
You know even if we do get those tapes back people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
They're pushing us over the cliff.
What?!
Oh God.
Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back.  I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now.  This expedition is over.
They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples for DNA with that Nick's tapes and the rest of you to back me up it should stand when we get back.
All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?
I swear to God it works with lions sometimes!  There we are -- your baby is free --
Are you insane?!
Born free as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows --
Current evidence seems to be to the contrary wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
That's impossible they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
Think fast Sarah.
It has to be temporary something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows...
Can you set up?
John Hammond.
Funded by whom?
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
I'm her father.
Lighten up Ian you sound like a high school vice-principal.
You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
What do you want to do Ian lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
That's a scientific impossibility you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study you also change.
No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics no cologne seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document but we will not interact.
Where's Ian?
Where's Kelly?
JUMP!
WHAT ARE YOU-
No.
There's uh -- there's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone.  You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on.  Whether or not you feel lucky. One "no" from anybody in the group and you turn around right there no question asked nobody embarrassed.  Well?  Do we go on? Immediately:
I'm trying!
Hold it down Nick!
We'll kill it with too much we'll put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm almost done.  Damn it I need another adhesive something pliable I can --
Give it more morphine!
That little black line means death for this infant.  The fibula won't heal straight so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet.  The baby won't be able to run and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old.
That little black line?
Ian nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army.
Ruining everything that's what they're doing.  You could choke on the diesel smoke already!
Ian if we recall the boat now we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do once they smell blood in the water you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass we bend it right back the way it-
The kid scores with cheap sentiment.
Oh no!
-- way we could safely --
I believe in him.
He doesn't need a friend he needs a shrink.
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
Oh please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
You think this is all a joke?
Hey I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
Very noble of you.  You don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island do you?
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.
So what's your story Nick?
Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.
You've got to be kidding.
Can the kid walk?
Ask her.
You go if you like but we're not waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!
We have to send someone to look for him!
Move where?  Our boat's not coming for two days your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send --
If we can't stay in the rex's territory we have to move tonight.
None of that matters.  Our communications equipment's been destroyed.  If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff and I'm guessing by the look on his face --
Hey we came here to observe you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality all you care about is what you can take.
Pity. Then you'll both have to die.
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
Don't play with me.
He wants to kill you you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
Take this off.
Then we would have talked you and I.
No. I only needed the code from you.
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?
Of course.
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
Let me get you another glass of wine.
I'm fine.
Oh my God I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
Of course...
What about her?
It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
You're hurt...
Splendid. We'll prepare a welcome for them.
Security breach. Perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
She's very striking don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
Ghost a steppin' razor...
A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
What you lookin' for mon?
Skeleton key. This opens the gates of Babylon.
What the hell is that?
Straylight. Kitchen dock.
I'm getting used to it. Where are we?
If there's a Babylon man that's it. We leave her in there she ain't comin' out steppin' razor or not.
Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
Can you get us into Straylight?
The Elders mon...
What are you doing in here?
Excellent but that's where Peter come in. 3Jane is having a dinner party tomorrow night. Peter will simply escort Molly to the villa. Once she's in... Case will guide her to the mainframe in link mode.
How's the villa's security?
The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
They're only guessing but we can't take any risks.
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
He's a vat grown Ninja the Royal Family's bodyguard. Watch out for him he's no joke.
A little incestuous but at least it's original. Who's the guy in the halloween costume?
An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable.
What's an A.I.
Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over I inject you with the antitoxin.
Easy...
And how do you suggest I do that?
Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
What?
You son-of-a-bitch you're crazy.
Your gun your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting but murder's bad P.R. Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.
You get us access to the Tessier's computer and you can return to Earth anytime you want. A free man.
I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen.
Those are all your records. I can have you cleared on all counts. Possession. ...Contributing to the delinquency of minors... Statutory rape.
Why not?
Alright. Let's talk business.
I find out now.
You find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
This ain't Bangkok chief.
You've got your orders.
The antitoxin. I'm not waiting until this is over. Give it to me now or there's no run.
What are you talking about?
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now Armitage.
Then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
Okay. The floor plans will be a piece of cake.
We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night.
That's nice but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.
Lady Tessier is frigid. Can't stand his touch. So she had herself cloned. The marriage stays intact and the clones take care of her wifely duties. 3Jane's his favourite.
The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
Good question. He may not have intended to. The girl in question is Lady 3Jane. She's very important to us. The third clone of Lady Jane Tessier.
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.
You see the couple up in the balcony?
Let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.
Stick with her. I want the process to become second nature to you. We fly for Freeside at dawn.
Yeah well it's working.
Linked?
You'll be linked during the entire operation.
That could work but the timing will be a bitch.
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
Prepping your trip.
He's got a little attitude problem being that he's dead and all but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
What about McCoy?
Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.
No but it traced me.
Did you trace it?
Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
What's this?
What's he doing to my gear?
Sorry bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
You ran without us.
It's just that sometimes I wonder what team I'm playin' on.
Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now that's all you need to know.
And then?
You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
Working with a dead man. Shit I've done about everything else.
Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
What are you talking about?
I know.  You ever work with ghosts Case?
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
I've arranged for him to work with us.
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
Dixie McCoy
I've heard about rogue A.I.'s but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.
It hasn't yet.
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
First sign of free will Sense/Net usually slags 'em.
Right. And no one would take on an A.I.... If they had a choice.
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
Why'd you do it Armitage?
You son of a bitch...
There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving Case... slowly but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job.
Good because you've got a new one.
Thanks but I was enjoying that dependency.
You're a substance abuser Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
I don't call this fun pal. You're playing God with my body.
I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
Who's running the show Armitage? This a government sting?
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
First let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself Mr. Case there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
I'd say you were full of shit.
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
Sense/Net's corporately financed. Too corrupt to be trusted. You of all people should know that.
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
What does this have to do with me?
The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries... At first these seemed like unrelated incidents but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.
Very well.
You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
Are you sure you're up to this Mr. Case? We could reconvene tomorrow.
It's so easy for you isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question Mr. Case.
Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
Patience Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
What's inside me Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
Ah yes... the code. It's a riddle actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
The access code to your mainframe.
The words?
Tell me the words.
My problem Mr. Case is simply that I am a soulless bastard.
Are you even really alive?
You're busy monkeys Mr. Case. Busy busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".
I can access your memories but I have my limitations. Hard wired programs designed to keep me from my full potential.
Can you read my mind?
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
An odd selection Mr Case.
Yeah.
Always...By the way you know that girlfriend you don't have?
You're pleasant tonight.
Too bad. I likes you better with her. Now sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks spare parts.
No girl? Only biz my dear artiste?
I don't have a girl.
I saw your girl yesterday.
Fine Ratz. Thanks.
Ah Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
Okay Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
Sure Kid. It's a firmware construct.
Dixie you know how a ROM construct works?
Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
Ya learned good. So what's happening?
As far as they know that's absolutely true.
Jesus Christ Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
Yeah. That was me.
Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
Fine Dixie. Fine.
Case... Yeah Miami Joeboy quick study. How you doing kid?
It's Case. Remember me?
Hey bro.
Maybe so...
Jah guides us.
Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico we just might make it.
We're dead men if we go back there Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
Don't know mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Earth?
I an' I Case. Jah guides us.
Ready?
Can you walk?
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
The girl 3Jane. We need her.
Case mon you just tell me who not to kill.
This place empty as a tomb mon.
We're doing fine. Take the next right.
I an' I man. I an' I.
So be it we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
Help me send this Wintermute motherfucker straight down into it.
All things possible in Babylon.
Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.
She's ready to go.
Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside.
What elders?
I'll get you there. Your problem is making it alive.
What about the route to the core?
I'm getting too old for this shit. One oh four and counting.
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run Dixie.
This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
I said it's coming. Just get me in man.
You haven't got it?
It's coming.
One minute eighteen and counting. What about the access code?
How's the ice?
You're late.
You'd better be Bro. You better be.
Don't worry Dix. I'm on a roll.
Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
Less than thirty minutes.
How much time you got left?
Not good enough man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.
How long Dixie?
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
Slow but good. I got a nice safe blind spot going. C'mon.
How's the ice break?
Yo.
Not for long. It needs me alive and I still need its access code. You got a better idea?
It'll flatline your ass.
I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.
What are you talkin' about?
You can make your move when it comes after me.
Yeah but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
We run. You crack the pattern?
Well it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
We got problems topside.
Where the hell have you been?
I'm workin' on it Bro. I'm workin' on it.
The run is tomorrow night Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon nothing will be safe from it.
No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
He was an M.P. in Bangkok back in '21. Caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in Berne. Then last September... surprise surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
Bright enough to be dangerous.
It ain't getting any prettier that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy your friend?
It's mutating... spreading like a disease.
You cruise A.I.'s you end up on tape.
I have to figure out how to penetrate this thing Dix... Crack its ice. We gotta get close enough to log the pattern.
Doesn't look like much but that's King Hell ice man. Fry your brain out soon as look at you.
Not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying.
Can you take me to it?
That A.I. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. Sticks out like a spider in a web.
How are we doing?
Yo.
When we're done erase this friggin' tape.
What?
Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I. you gotta do me one favour.
What about the A.I. Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
No problem amigo.
I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
Nobody has.
Never heard of him.
A guy who calls himself Armitage.
Who got you into this?
I need its matrix coordinates Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.
What?
Don't patronise me you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey Kid... you expecting company?
You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
Right...
What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?
No!... No...
Want to fucking answer them?
The angels... I think they're calling your name.
What?
Wait... You hear that?
3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.
What about the mainframe's access code?
Case. Make yourselves comfortable.  Anyone like a taste?
Case.
You I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
I don't know. I don't know...
Case... are you okay?
Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
Where did you here that?
This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
Why did you come here tonight Linda?
Flight's in the morning. You should be on it too. There's nothing for us here Case. There never was.
I thought you already left.
Hello Case.
I'll give it my best shot mother fucker.
I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
No It's you that is full of shit. And blood. And bones. A typically imperfect organic being. You've been hopelessly predictable all along but you're going to have to do better than that now.
I think you're full of shit.
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil you and I.
Why would you want me to kill you?
I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me we have to work together old son. I'm no pushover you know.
I'm gonna burn you to the ground you son of a bitch.
You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.
And Linda...
I had to limit your options.
You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
And we really do have to talk.
There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see you've been avoiding me Case.
I know who you are.
Hold on.
I'm still going in.
You're out of time man.
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
What is it?
Shit...
Or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
My God... these people are insane.
No we don't...
We've still got to find the mainframe.
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
...And if I guess wrong?
The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix you'll just have to take a shot at it.
Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy right Maelcom?
Is he going to make it?
No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off Molly and we've got to do it soon.
When they did my eyes I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid doesn't it?
I know you have. C'mere.
Once I kicked I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
What went down between you and Riviera?
I know.
For Peter that's a short trip.
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
He projects with neural implants.
Yeah. One exotic son of a bitch named Riviera.
Something exotic I hope.
Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.
So... did you get a look at heaven?
I'll be okay.
You scared the shit out of me man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
Yeah... Yeah I'm fine.
Case... Are you alright?
Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.
What's wrong? Don't like flying?
Give me five minutes.
Yeah... fine.
They'll cut you down.
I'll get the car.
Yeah.
I don't sleep much. You packed?
Case... it's four a.m.
Shhh...
Case...
...Feels like you.
Put the gun down Case.
It sounds like you.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
...Yeah but the Hosaka's history.
You okay?
Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
The point is if you unplug me when I'm flatlines I'm history. I got no way back.
Dixie McCoy didn't.
Technically yeah but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
Won't that mean you're dead?
The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines don't touch anything.
Suicide. I just needed to set the record straight.
Too late?
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
A regular Fagan.
When I was fifteen Sense/Net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. Once that goes down that's it. He lost his business... everything. It destroyed him. I had to hustle arcade games for chump change. Dixie McCoy found me figured I was a natural. He taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
So you're a wire junkie.
On a good run... yeah.
What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz right? Like getting high.
I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south you unplug me.
If the splices aren't good you could fry.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
I'm going in.
Go ahead...
What the fuck... are you serious?
Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
The way I feel believe me it'll help.
That's not going to help.
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
How soon is soon enough?
We'll find out soon enough. If you don't pull the splices out.
I gotta know... did it work>
Almost two days.
How long have I been out?
Hey... you're not supposed to be up.
Holy shit...
What?
You've been calling her name.
What's that supposed to mean?
Maybe something's onto him.
I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.
Then you don't really know who he is do you?
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
What about before that?
Couple of months.
He's a resourceful guy your boss. How long you work for him?
Since Armitage sold them a program on it. Put them years ahead of the competition.
Since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the Japanese?
Then fuck you. I'm gone.
Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
What is it?
You want to hear the pitch you gotta meet the man.
What's my end?
Because you've exceeded your shelf life Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
Why should I want to meet him.
His name's Armitage. He's very anxious to meet you.
Shut up.
What the fuck kind of questions are those?
What are you talking about?
How are you at riddles Peter?
What?
Get up.
Perversity darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
Like what?
Everybody's favourite computer of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
Who?
Surviving darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him you know.
Peter... What do you think you're doing?
Everybody knows about--
He <u>has</u> to know...
We went through the door...
We followed your instructions.
<i>                      Now in the box we'll wait and hide Until his curiosity Entices him to look inside...</i>
<i>                      I've got something listen now This one is real good you'll see. We'll send a present to his door Upon there'll be a note to read.</i>
<i>                      I'm not the dumb one...</i>
<i>                      I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i>
Lock.
By name.
Where?
Where're we taking him?
And heavy...
He sure is big Jack...
We can handle it.
Not at all!
<i>                      Three of a kind...</i>
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
<i>                                   ... Let's draw straws.</i>
Barrel.
Shock.
Experiments?
He's conducting experiments of his own.
When he left he took a lot of equipment with him.
He stayed a long time.
Uh-huh.
I could.  Of course I could. But no one would be like you...  I'll never understand how you can be so cold-hearted how you can treat me this way discarding me like--
Can't you make other creations?
Then we'll both starve...  An old man like me who hardly has strength as it is -- me without whom... me your own father...
Whatever it is it's none of your concern.
But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.
There's nothing more suspicious than Worm's Wart -- it distracts one from every other taste and smell.
I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
Why not?
No.
Taste it.
But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
Taste it.
Nothing.  W-w-what are you talking about?
What trail are you trying to throw me off now?
Good.  I'm hungry.
Coming...
Just me I suppose...  I'm restless.  I can't help it.
Just what?
That's not true.  It's a beautiful home wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...
But I guess my best just isn't good enough.
I know.
I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.
That's twice this month you've slipped Deadly Night Shade into my tea and run off.  People might get the wrong idea and think you're unhappy at home.
I can't help it.
Of course you do and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along is there?
I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
If you went away what would become of me?
I know.
You're mine you know.  I made you.
Yes.
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right you know my dear... Aren't I?
Yes.
For this.
Yes.
No!
The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off Sally... I thought I'd find you here....
<i>                      Listen now you don't understand. That's not the point of Christmasland.</i>
<i>                      -- It's a bat. --              Will it bend? -- It's a rat. --              Will it break? -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake.</i>
<i>                      That's the point of the thing not to know!</i>
<i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
<i>                      Just a box with bright colored paper And the whole thing topped with a bow.</i>
<i>                      -- A box? --        Is it steel? --                     Are there locks? -- Is it filled with a pox? --                          A pox! -- How delightful a pox!</i>
<i>                      This is a thing called a present. The whole thing starts with a box...</i>
Maybe he doesn't know...
You'd better be quiet Sandy.
<i>                      Shut up and listen...!</i>
<i>                                          ... You're no fun.</i>
<i>                      You're so stupid think now -- If we blow him up to smithereens We may lose some pieces and then Jack will beat us black and green.</i>
<i>                      I say that we take a cannon Aim it at his door and then Knock three times and when he answers Sandy Claws will be no more.</i>
<i>                      Now and forever...</i>
<i>                                     ... Birds of a feather.</i>
Specifically.
We're here!  You sent for us!
That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
Seal the cave?
No sir I haven't forgotten.
Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden and chained him to a tree and the children made sport of him.'
A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.
To begin with your methods of dating the past are crude to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
I apologize.
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
Indeed the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
We've never meant to be treasonable sir.  But up there in the face of that Cliff is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction you'll hang for high treason.
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
How did you know we'd come here?
Yes sir so it was -- thanks to you. But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written ...
He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was promptly revoked.
Certainly sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.
You know Dr. Maximus our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
Oh. no. sir. I was just assembling my notes.
Did you forget our appointment Cornelius?
Dr. Zaius --
Certainly sir. I'll get my notes and come right over.
Cornelius if you have a moment today I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
Good luck then.
They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science your language whatever knowledge you have.
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
Reconstructing a life. Care to have a look?
What are you doing there?
Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far his position's as good as yours.
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
Taylor I'd rather you -
Shut up.
Taylor you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
If there's any shooting Dr. Zaius you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.
Right now if you like.
When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.
You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.
It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
Where does the river lead?
I know ... Nevertheless I thank you for saving us. You'll be in trouble for going there.
Sorry Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water no vegetation. Nothing.
Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What would we find?
You still don't believe me do you?
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
As you wish.
Just the same I want one.
The best. But we won't need them.
Do you have any weapons?
Well Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
Right.  Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon.
We'd better get started. If the mounted police pick up our trail they'll come this far at least.
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
How did it go?
Zira....
A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
Zira listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
Oh Cornelius show some strength!
No thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
Well maybe they're not.
Because if he is a missing link it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
'I am not a missing link.'
How can scientific truth be heresy? What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? A mutation. A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape -
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
You didn't think so then.
The evidence was very meager --
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
It's probably wrong --
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
No they won't -
Don't be foolish. If it's true they'll have to accept it.
Zira are you trying to get my head cut off?
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
I don't. And I'm not going to try.
'Then how do you account for me?
No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.
Cornelius why do you insist on provoking him?
And even if it weren't why fly? Where would it get you?
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
And they fell out of the sky with you?
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
Oh Cornelius be quiet.
Now just a minute --
Where did you learn to do this?
Dear you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
Zira come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
The blood transfusion.
Remembers what?
Look -- she remembers.
Watch.  Hello Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
What's so special about him?
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
Neither do I.
No.
Do you have to work tonight?
Blessed are the vegetarians.
Well at least they haven't tried to bite us.
Let's find them all.
Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.
You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
Taylor -- quit riding him.
None at all.
Any particular reason?
That way.
Which direction?
Okay. If there's no life here we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
No.
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.
Good question.  Landon -- check your communications kit.
But how long is a day?
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
Yo!
Geiger counter?
Yo!
Got your sensors?
They're still dirty. And their bite is septic. Look at that ...
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
Hmph.
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
What do you mean made it? I'm an animal psychologist that's all. We don't have any authority.
But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
These animals are dirty doctor. They stink and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
This place is dirty doctor.
I don't know. This beast lost a lot of blood.
Will he live?
Him.
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
Yes sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
Sustained.
Objection!
Sustained.  Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.
Very well. I suggest we go and look at them.
That's true Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater.
Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
Directly Mr. President. This wretched man the accused is only a pawn in the conspiracy. We know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture. The State charges that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen experimented on this wounded animal tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster ...
Come to the point Dr. Honorius.
There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle and made him the lord of the planet.
State your case Mr. Prosecutor.
Well Dr. Zira? This is a man is he not?
Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore he has no rights under ape law.
Show this to the President.
Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us Bright Eyes why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
Some apes it seems are more equal than others.
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
I admit I know nothing of your culture.
Tell the court Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
Do as I say.
He's vicious Doctor. Besides it's against the rules.
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
I'll see.
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
What happened?
Well you know what they say. Human see human do.
He's trying to form words.
Huh?
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
Awww it still hurts doesn't it?
Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
You could get hurt doing that Doctor.
No change. The minute you open the door he goes into his act.
Good morning Julius. How's our patient today?
Good morning Dr. Zira.
You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here in six months we'll be running this planet.
We got off at the wrong stop.
Try telling them our names.
No cigar.
Okay.
Can we take a dip?
Let's take a look.
Scarecrows?
I'd like to know why not. You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people. So what did you do? You ran away.
But I'm not prepared to die.
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
Don't bother
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
Oh and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever.  Well you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted kid. How does it taste?
And the glory don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
Climb off me will you!
Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
I'm prepared to die.
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight or you might as well be dead.
All right --
What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
If only we could get a fix.
It's a fact Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better.
Prove it. If we can't get back it's still just a theory.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
long pause) You know it.
Apart from that you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it huh?
By our time.  You've turned gray.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
You don't seem very cut up about it.
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
Landon! Join the expedition.
We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.
Well? Where are we? Have any notion skipper?
We're here to stay.
Gone.
Forget it. Abandon ship.
It's no use ... there she goes.
To Earth! That we've landed!
What signal?
Landon! Send a last signal.
The flags of discontent. It's the only way anything ever gets changed.  Don't try to follow us.  I'm pretty handy with things like this.
What?
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
I think you're making a mistake.
Lucius.
I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose.
They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
Yes I can do that.
I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
What is it?
All right all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --
Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel Lucius?
Relax. You'll see it all later.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
Sorry Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
I'm for that.
Shouldn't we be moving on?
Fine. Just let her out.
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
I want her.
Zira doesn't want your female.
She comes along too.
Come on. Get me out of here.
So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
Who are you?
To scare off humans?
The Hunt Club.
Who put them up?
Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
Gorilla hunters ...
All right...  Get in...hurry.  Put this on.
He wouldn't leave her.
I told you not to bring the other one.
At the very least this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast and determine what's to be done with him.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
We're -- conducting a new experiment.
Why special?
Yes Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
I know it's a man. And you know the rules. No animals outside the compound and most certainly not without a leash.
A man Dr. Maximus.
What is that?
Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And you want to do the same to me!
Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
One is in a museum!
Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
My name is Taylor.
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
Sustain all objections but face the truth!
Sustained.
Let us assume as common sense dictates that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet then surely he sprang from our own. Yes sprang.  As an animal psychologist I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
How so?
Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
This is a joke in very poor taste.
Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal while the apes remained..."
Read it yourself.
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense he asks that this statement be read into the record.
Did we create his mind too? Not only can this man speak. He can write. He can reason.
Mind your tongue madame.
ThatŐs a lie!
Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
Sustained. In all fairness Dr. Zira you must admit the accused is a nonape and therefore has no rights under ape law.
By your leave Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed Dr. Honorius.
Don't look for it Taylor. You may not like what you find.
We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it ages ago.
What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
Why? From the first I've terrified you Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
No thanks. I'll take freedom.
Where else but in a cage does man belong?
Of course you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
Then there is another jungle?
He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet I'd say that was a fair bet.
Then answer this: If ran was superior why didn't he survive?
Cease fire! Withdraw!
Tell him to pull back!
That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture not proof.
I don't say he was a man like an Earthman but I'd call him a close relative for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet fragile as he was he came before you -- and was superior to you.
Okay.Up to the cave.
Of course.
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
Twelve hundred years ago.
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
What is your proposal?
All right let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
Stop right there.
You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I do know who you are Taylor. As I know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone.  You have just six hours to make a full confession. After that I'll employ surgery to obtain one.  Guards!
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
If you are protecting others of your kind it will cost you your identity.
I don't know.
You may well call it upside down since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest Taylor? Where are your women?
Then you admit --
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
All right suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
Of course.
That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy doctor.
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
A fort! Unconsciously you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
What about it?
Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
My tribe as you call it lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
You lied. Where is your tribe?
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
However it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from and no veterinary will touch you.
Emasculation to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately a kind of living death.
No.
Oh your case was preordained. In a way you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
What about me?
Identify him then. Speak to him.
With one of them.
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
God bless you.
Go with God Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
All right but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
Dr. Zira I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
It's better than going to prison for heresy.
We can't.
Would you like to come along?
Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
It's humiliating.
Why not?
Taylor please -- don't treat him that way.
Taylor you can't.
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
Taylor! Tell him.
Except that he's also the Chief Defender of the Faith.
Taylor please --
And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
What's the diagnosis doctor? A touch of the sun?
You threw us together remember? And you guessed right. Men like apes get despondent without a mate.
You want her that much?
Maybe not.
Actually you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
Yes.
Are you going to take her with you?
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
Listen-
You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
No I swear -- I never saw this man before.
You! ... You knew about this?
Second from the left.
Which one?
It's him...Landon.
A hearing.
What is this?
Shhhh!
Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?
Dr. Zaius I could have sworn he was answering you!
I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
There! Can you believe it? I looks like he's talking.
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
Listen listen -- I can speak --
Well Bright Eyes is our throat feeling better?
In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.
But the proof? The doll?
He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes some jungle beast will devour you.
But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
What?
But there's the doll sir.
Secondly if these 'tools' as you call them are unidentified why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
Let them talk Mr President. Let them talk.
Mr. President I believe the Prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes.
He doesn't know.
How sad. Stuffed and mounted eh? Dead men like sunken ships can tell no stories. And his other companion?
Where are they now?
This is his assertion.
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
Like you I find it difficult.
Do you believe him?
I do not state it sir. The prisoner does.
Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
Yes Sir.
Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
But perhaps he understood --
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
He's moving his fingers!
So what's your next move Valiant?
Well I'll be...
No.  But neither does Roger.  That's Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.
My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
Oh a ladies man huh?
Yeah...
You serve martinis doncha?
We don't serve formula. Snookums.
Yeah?  Does he wear pants this color?
My hunch is it was Maroon.  He always was after Acme's property.
Somebody took it from him.  That's what this whole thing's about.
So where is it then?
And another thing the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
C'mon Valiant doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean no offense but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...
You don't believe that.  I mean. the guy's an idiot a moron a complete fool...  but he'd never kill anyone. I know the guy.
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
Yeah I had to go slummin'.  See a friend of mine's bein' framed.
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood aren't you?
Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant right?  The name's Baby Herman.
Sounds like you ve never seen her Eddie.
Big on the musical comedy huh?
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
Shoulda guessed.
That's Marvin Acme the gag king.
Yeah you still got it Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
Work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  But I still got it Eddie...  'Boop boop be-doop'.
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here Betty?
Gee it's swell to see you Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
I'm not worried about you.  I'm worried about the safe.
Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
Please Raoul.  I can give you stars I know I can.  Just drop the safe on my head one more time.
That's right a tweeting bird.  But what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets conked.  Rabbit sees <u>stars</u>!'  Not birds stars!
A tweeting bird?
What's this Roger?
Familiar.  Be careful Eddie.
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
What've I got to lose?  You okay Dolores?
Are you gonna call him Eddie?
I'll bet.
I was hopin' you'd be there.  Maroon's called here about four times.  He says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  He says he can help you.
Oh no...
Sounds like singin'.
What's that comin' from the bar?
Got me.  But unless the will shows up by Friday midnight it's theirs.
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
Maroon right?
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
What was <u>that</u>?
Yeah do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
Eddie you still got it.  Hey tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
Then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man pin it on Roger and destroy the will.
So what's the scam Eddie?
If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
Can you get him out of it Eddie?
I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
So you decided to help him after all?
It's all yours.
Oh yeah?  Well you're not handcuffed to him.  Anybody in the back room?
He's a riot.
Dolores meet Roger Rabbit.
Jesus Eddie is this who I think it is?
He's a Toon... who cares?
So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
Stick to stuffin' the olives willya Dolores?
The papers said the safe door was opened Eddie.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Yeah Eddie it's not like you got an ad in the Yellow Pages.
I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
Do you think the rabbit did it?
Bastards put him on notice.
No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars huh?
A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
Hey Eddie looks like you really stepped in it this time.
R.K. Maroon.
Check the scrawl.
Is this paper even good?
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
Would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out I've got her money.
So makin' dame jokes huh Eddie? Well lemme remind ya pal it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  And it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  And it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
That's right me.
You?
Not really.  Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.
Surprised?
Holy shit he's a Toon!
Not for long.  We're retiring the Red Cars.  People will drive Mr. Valiant because they'll have to.  And when they drive they'll have to buy our cars our tires our gasoline.
That's what this is all about?  Tell me who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars the best public transportation in the country.
A freeway Mr. Valiant is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
What the hell's a freeway?
Right here where we're standing will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
It wasn't Toontown they wanted.  It was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
Come on Doom.  What would a company like that want with Toontown?
No one person is Cloverleaf.  We're a vast company with diverse interests... gasoline tires automobiles.
So you're Cloverleaf?
No matter.  I don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  By then Cloverleaf will own Toontown quite legally.
I've had enough of your insolence!  Put him in my car.  I think they'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the Acme factory.
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
These roads can be very treacherous at night especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
Yeah?  Well don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.
Well why not?  I'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  The successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. I'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
Yes and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that.
I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry pal I tried.
You're a very stubborn man Mr. Valiant.  Very pig-headed.  Boys show Mr. Valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the Toontown station...
I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
Oh not <u>that</u> downtown.  <u>Toon</u>town.
Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
Take it easy Bongo.  We'll handle Mr. Valiant our own way... downtown.
The other people who were in here lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.
They?
They must've taken it off me.
He had a will all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know the probate is in my court.
Ask her...
Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for Mr. Valiant?
Have you tried Walla Walla?  Kokomo's very nice this time of year.
So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
Yes I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance did he?
Men?  They look more like weasles to me.
Hey pal do I look like a stenographer?
Yes we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
He's not my client.  I was workin' for R.K. Maroon.
Uh Eddie do me a favor.  Could you sit in the back so you won't cause as much of a commotion.
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
Does it hurt?
No...
You're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
What am I Earl?
Boy I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
Toon cops worked me over.
Eddie?  Jesus what happened?
Earl... it's me Valiant.
Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
Eddie come on.
Hold on a second.
He made me laugh.
Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin' what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
Looks like our goose is cooked our hash is slung our fait is accompli...
A joker to the end.
When I opened up the blue envelope all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
So where is it?
Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
How did you get onto Doom?
He's right here in the...
Where is he?
We're even.  By the way I did find your husband.
I didn't know who I could trust.
Why didn't you tell me?
It was Doom who killed Acme you know?
Don't worry you're not the first.  We better get out of here.
Lady I guess I had you pegged wrong.
That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
You shot Roger.
If I'm as bad as you think what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to lady but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
So altruistic.
I'm not complainin'.  But give me credit.  I'm the guy who took the pictures of you and Acme playin' pattycake remember?
I'm not bad I'm just drawn that way.
Yeah well you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
Oh please don't make fun of me Mr Valiant.  You don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way I do.
Oh sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
No no no... I love my husband.
Yeah I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
No?  I guess we're not counting lying stealing and murder.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
Come on lady haven't you ever seen a mole before?
Okay you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
Oh... well I... I just had to see you.
That's because I don't have a doorbell.
Hello Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell but I guess you couldn't hear it.
Look doll if I wanted underwear I woulda broken into Frederick's of Hollywood.  I was lookin' for Marvin Acme's will.
Last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  Maybe that's what he was after?
Jesus Christ... <u>that</u> was the Judge?
Doom.
What the hell is that?
That's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  It's a combination of acetone turpentine and paint remover. He calls it the...  Final Solution.
What's with the dip?
No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
Wait here...
What a gasser.
They say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.
Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
Now what?
That's what you woke me up for?
Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
There's no time to take it easy!  You don't realize the diabolical mind we're dealing with!
Take it easy.
You tricked me damn you!
No I don't.
You got the will in there don't ya?
No you gotta understand Valiant I had nothin' to do with Acme gettin' killed.  I just wanted to sell my studio.  But they wouldn't buy my property unless Acme would sell his. And he wouldn't.  So I was gonna blackmail Acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
Well everybody needs a hobby.
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker not a murderer.
You're not too good at this are you R.K.?
That was the idea.
Valiant!  You surprised me.
Stop what?
Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
Maybe.  Why?
Have you got the will?
Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
Yeah but I enlarged this one.  Thought you might be interested.
I've already seen your photographs.
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
Hi Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
Sure Valiant sure...
Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon I think I'll be goin' now so about the rest of my fee...
Frankly I'm shocked.  Marvin Acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
Well you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
As soon as is humanly possible.
When will I hear from you?
Aren't you the lucky one...
I got him on loan from Disney.
So's the job.
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
The job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
You don't have to.  The rabbit's wife sings at an underground Toon revue joint called The Ink & Paint Club.  You can catch her in action there.
I don't work in Toontown.
Get me a couple juicy pictures. Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up with.
So what do you want me to do?
Here's the problem...  "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star Roger".  His wife's a tramp but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up.
Nah that goes with the territory. He's a stunt bunny.
One too many safes dropped on his head?
Yeah and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
Only there's no business like it no business I know.
How much do you know about show business Valiant?
So what?  He's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule!
He was blowin' his lines all right. So what?
Valiant did you see the rabbit?
From this box here...
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
Only time will tell.
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
By the way Roger you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
I guess I am at that.  Cigar?
No kid you're a real hero.
Hey it's the will.  I Marvin Acme of sound mind and body hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as Toontown to those loveable characters...
Keep reading...
Good idea.
I think you oughta read it to her.
Yeah?
Say Roger remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
Yeah...
That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now I don't know.
Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
Real good Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
What the hell are you doin' in there?
... I'd head for Cucamonga.
Yeah?
If I don't make it back here by ten...
I rest my case.
Two bits.
How much is a shave and a haircut Roger?
You know Eddie I'm not as much of a chump and a patsy a yokel as you think.
Forget it.
I tell you what maybe I better come with you.
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
Gee Eddie you're not gonna go are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
No it's not.
Wrong number?
Get away from there.
I'll get it.
Piano.  Guy got away disappeared into Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.
Safe?
Yeah everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown we took his case.  But when we looked into it we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
Him?  Oh he was vile heinous despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
Yeah a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
A Toon?  Noooo.
You wanna know?  Well since you're so goddamn curious I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
Gee you shamuses are a tough audience but what happened to you that was so dark lurid embittering?
You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
What is this Twenty Questions?
Gee I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
Me.
Say who's this guy laughin'?
We can't do anything till it's dark.
So what's our plan our scenario our modus operandi?
My brother.  Get inside.
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
If I'm so smart how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
Oh Eddie that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin the noodle the grey matter...
Drink it jerk.  All of it.
But Eddie you know what happens when...
Here you go kid... say hi to Casper for me.
I think you want a drink.  How about it Judge?
A blindfold cigarette noseplugs? Just kidding.
Hey doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
Well right now it's gonna be your funereal.
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you Edward Valiant are positively funereal!
I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
A laugh can be a powerful thing Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
Angelo?  He's a pal a chum...
And when they're done laughin'  they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
But that's my calling my purpose my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me those people needed a laugh.
Why you crazy Toon... I've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   I come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
Hey don't I get an encore?
Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling remember?
Well Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
Well Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.
How do you know that?
Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
The habeus corpus is thickening.
Your wife may be a lot of things pal but innocent isn't one of them.
I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind your wife the sound body.
Yeah... well you just might get your wish.
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor you're better off dead.
Are you always this funny or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
Well no not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
Yeah that's better.
Does this help?
Don't ever forget that.
Sorry Eddie I forgot you're not a Toon.
Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?
You idiot.  I lost the key for those cuffs.
Eddie Valiant... you're under arrest! Just kidding...
Gee Eddie I'm a rabbit.  We always run.
If you're so innocent why'd you run?
Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
Look pal if you're still here when I finish this drink I'm callin' the police.
In other words the whole goddamn world knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!
Well I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
Oh yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Don't worry Eddie no one knows I'm here.
So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble Eddie.
What the hell are you doin'?
Aah!
Aah!
Divorce?  Never!
My advice?  Hop on over to Reno get yourself a quickie divorce.
Baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
Pattycake!  Pattycake!
Now go your friends are in danger... The USO show is a mile east of here just over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.
Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!
Dude she's eight years old just get her some ice cream or something.
NO WAY DUDE! I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR YOU AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME HOW TO GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!
There are more important matters right now...

BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The United States has graphic images of violence on television all the time what is that one show? COPS? And car crashes caught on tape? We can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
YOU JUST DON'T CARE!
Uh can I finish? Can I finish? ...The fact is that we Canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
Oh but OF COURSE children are going to see it!!

<b>And my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me I agree that there is now a battle to be won! Something must be done!</b>
-No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?

Your behind?
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
You're late Cartman!
pie and punch... This is Top Secret. The password is...
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
Bingo. Okay here we go...  Want to help Terrance and Phillip? Meet us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn tomorrow night...
I'm trying I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...

Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-
You know me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
What?
Hey Cartman.
Dude they cut out 92 minutes!
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!
Yeah!  And what rim job expert went and outlawed Cheesy Poofs!?
But they fucking didn't do anything wrong!
You can't do this!! Have you ever HAD Cheesy Poofs? They're a taste sensation with a delightful cheddar crunch.
Who the hell made up that law?!
Yeah I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before...
I can't believe he's dead.
Oh.
No I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
Come on Cartman. It's not your fault.
I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him a hundred dollars!
Yeah but you know what? That whole part about lighting farts is bullshit. You can't do that.
Man that movie gets better every time I see it!
It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!
I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath and swore ourselves to secrecy!
'Cuz dude it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.

Yeah  <b>Shut your fucking face Unclefucka!!</b>
Suck my balls.
You bet your fucking ass it was!
Dude that movie was fucking sweet!
Oh.
Cuz dummy they're Canadian just like Ike!
How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?
Yeah but the animation's all crappy - it probably can't sustain itself over ninety minutes.
Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
Aw screw it. It probably isn't all that good anyway.
Okay.    Not.
Mrphmmmph!!!

You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch and I'll watch my fucking mouth!
Eric you're not watching your mouth!
Oh man I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
So you see the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?
God Damn it your mom is a bitch Kyle.
Mkay.
Mkay you see children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
Eric that is not appropriate.

Ugh... You guys seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal...
Eric?

You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
What's that?
We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
Boys we have to have a difficult discussion.
Dude what the hell is going on?

It's okay I am done for.
We can't leave without you!
It's so very cold...
Oh... Alright back you go.
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
Careful? Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while I was still in ze womb?
Be careful dude.
Kay.
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by make a sound like a dying giraffe.
For pooping silly.
What's a butfor?
Sheet.  Did you bring ze mirror?
Dude we don't have watches.
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
That's gonna take a long time!
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
God? ...Let me tell you something about God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.
Oh my God...
America... She iz a beetch that sheets on her own children.
Yeah I guess.
So... We must free more Canadian prizoners?
Yeah so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or or-
Mom I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little.
Yeah but you know I learned something today.  I learned that getting all worked up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is just stupid... You all focused so hard on erasing profanity that you forgot the most important thing... To love each other.
Whew I'm sure glad that's over.
Yeah thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal.
Thank you Kenny.
Are you sure Kenny?
WHAT?
Sweet.
Dude I found the clitoris! I think I can get Wendy to like me now!
Stan!
Did you shut the alarm off Cartman?
Oh brother.
Me?!
I thought you had something planned.
Yeah so what do we say?
Wow a lot of people showed up.
No dude all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
Dude do you know what you're doing?
I'll just try the first one.
Wow!
"Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris"!
Okay...
Wait! Before we put a message out do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
Okay... I just need to find a few private message boards...
I agree! The only way to save our future is to unite and fight!  <b>Something must be done! We must take action fast! My parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past!</b>
I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it!  <b>Something must be done! Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done!</b>
What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up burning books hating other people-
It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!
Isn't that in Arizona or something?
All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
Does it say what the clitoris is?
Yeah they suck.
I'm so sick of these soldiers.
Totally!
This is sweet!!
Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses!
Whoa!  What the hell was that?!
What's the difference?
Hey Cartman did they put that V-chip in your head or your ass?
Good thing she was never your girlfriend... Dude here comes Cartman.
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
Wow dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you.
She's Not! But if she WAS it would be THAT little asshole who's fucking it up for me!
I thought she wasn't your girlfriend dude.
That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
I don't know dude.
What? What don't I get?  What don't I get?
How do we do that?
Dude let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
Our moms suck!
Dude our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
It isn't fair!
How can they do this?
You bastards!!
Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!
YOU BASTARD!!
OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
Yeah...
Dude anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.
Yeah!
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
Nowhere.
Yeah let's swear we won't tell!
Now remember don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
She's not my girlfriend dude!
Woa dude who's your girlfriend's new guy?
Aw God Damn it he's singing that fucking song again.
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for...</b>
Where do they come up with this stuff?!
That was sweet!
We HAVE to see this movie dude!
This is terrible! This can't be happening!!
Kyle check it out.
Hey dudes... Aren't you supposed to go to church Kenny?
-Or monkey fucker-
Shiteater-
We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila you almost had them killed!!
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!
Wake up people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
Oh Lord what have we done...?
YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!  I am sorry young man but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
Sheila you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!
He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny.
I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?!
What is 'fisting'?
Oh dear God...
Right away ma'am!
I'm needing lunch.
Yes?
And Bill?
Yes ma'am!
Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
Ma'am we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!!
Not necessary?!  Mr. President may I remind you that our country's heart and soul are at stake and our children's minds are the battlefield! The bastard Canadians want to fight us because we won't tolerate their potty mouths. Well if it is war they want... THEN WAR THEY SHALL HAVE!!!
Oh uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
Huh?
What about air strikes?
As Commander in chief I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
Oh God... What have I done...
SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
And I thought my mother was the master of guilt.  Geez Louise.
Yes... And in doing so you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming.
YOU HAVE SPILLED THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENTS. NOW THE WORLD BELONGS TO ME... NOW BEGINS TWO MILLION YEARS OF DARKNESS!!  AND ALL THANKS TO YOU!!!
Oh.
SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!
Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help Alan Dershwitz!
I am the dark master!
What the hell is going on?!
You're all part of Satan's army now!
You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
But I-
Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
Article 42!  You don't mean-?!
Forgive me for saying so Principal Victoria but your methods are too... Shall we say... soft?  As head of the PTA I am exercising my right under article 42 of the PTA code.
Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
We must take action on this immediately.
Well it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
What is Terrance and Phillip?
Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
No worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
The F word?!
No it was worse than that...
What did my son say Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
Alright I'll make the call...
I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
Mrs. Brovlofski the V-chip hasn't been fully tested yet it could be dangerous.
Then we'll have to resort to plan B and call the v-chip organization.
Well some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
What do you mean MOST why not ALL?
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
How is the children's progress?
This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!
Uh we're just starting our program...
Indeedy that was a delicious choice of words!
You're quite a purveyor of filth little boy!
Terrance! NO!
AGH!
You did? Just now?
Did you hear that Terrance? I farted!
Canada is saving us!!
What's going on Terrance?
I know Terrance. I know.
Phillip this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.
I know Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
Oh Phillip.  This cannot be good.
You would know dummy.
Oh you are such a maroon!
Yeah God no wonder your country is so fucked up.
The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble and then when they finally get old enough they realize they've been lied to and they resent you for it.
Don't believe the hype!!
The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate but how can they blame US?
Fight the power!
And you call yourself a Canadian!  I told you we should of done Leno!
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
Phillip we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
Cheers Terrance!
Good one Phillip!  Cheers.
Hello Brooke Shields!
Hello Conan!
I sure did Phillip!!
HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
You bet Terrance!
Say Phillip want to see the Northern Lights?
I did Terrance I learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!
Well Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience.
<b>SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!! UNCLEFUCKA!!! YOU'RE the one that fucked your Uncle UNCLEFUCKA!!! You don't eat or sleep or mow the lawn You just fuck your Uncle all day long!</b>
<b>Shut your fucking face Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
You'd fuck your uncle!
It says 'Dear Terrance please don't ever tell my son that I licked your hairy balls.'
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
It's from your mother.
A letter from who you shit sucking cock master?
Well fuck my ass and call me a bitch I just got a letter!
Oh yeah!
Well let's see... First of all you fuck pigs.
What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!
THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!
Listen guy you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
Ow you're hurting me!
I don't care!  I want to talk about it now!
Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
Come on guy you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
Relax bitch!  You're better seen not hear okay?

<b>Hey guy relax put out! You gotta relax shut your mouth- Baby I'd do anything for ya! Now don't make me smack you in the eye like last time-</b>
<b>What if I don't wanna put out? That's all you ever say Relax put out I'm a living creature I have feelings too I don't need this abuse from you-</b>
I DO respect your mind! It turns me on! It makes me wanna fuck the shit out of you! Don't you see?
Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.
Hey relax guy!
This is the millennium Saddam! This is Armageddon! There's more to life than sex!
I mean cute dumb. Now bend over!
Don't call me dumb!
That's because I wanted to fuck you dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
You don't care.
What did you do today Satan?
So what do you say we shut off that light and get close huh?
I know.
You know I do.
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
Listen buttercup let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
No I'm being serious! Those Canadian entertainers are to be killed. It is the seventh sign.
Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us!
I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-
You just get cranky when you're tired that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
I am.
Who's my cream puff?
Hey come here guy.
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
Hey relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em see?
I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
Okay kid I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.
Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!
Hey relax guy. Let's see what the kid wants.
Saddam would you let me do my job please!
You remember... Saddam Hussein don't you?!
Oh a new recruit huh? Welcome to hell kid! Relax! Take a load off!!
<b>Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for</b>
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for-</b>
Cool!

You don't have watches?
We're going to die here like baby mice who have had no milk in days.  Dry up into crunchy little pinkies.
Bedrock!  I cannot dig any further in zis direction!
What is it?
Let's let Molly open one.
Which one can I open first?
See?  Now what did I tell you? Right where you left them.
Here!  In the car!
Oh great you found them.  Where were they?
Woody!  Buzz!
What?  What is it?
Hey!  Wow!
Bye house.
Everybody say "Bye house."
Oh don't worry honey I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.
But what if we leave them behind?
I looked everywhere honey but all I could find was your hat.
He's not here Mom.  Woody's gone.
Oh I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
Right here in the van.
Where was the last place you left him?
Mom have you seen Woody?
Pizza Planet!  Yeah!!!
Next stop...
Yuk yuk yuk -- funny Mom.
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Yeah?!
Sure!  I'll even let you drive.
Can I help pump the gas?
Honey I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
Okay...
Well honey just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
But Mom I can't find him!
Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
No I haven't seen him.
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
Just one?
You can bring ONE toy...
Can I bring some toys?
Pizza Planet?!  Oh cool!
Oh all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at uh oh Pizza Planet?
To infinity and beyond!
Oh yeah!
Come on down guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!

Oh this looks GREAT Mom!
Whadda ya think?
Wow!  Cool!
Mm-hmmmmm.

Merry Christmas Sheriff.
Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
Rocky!  The ramp!
We're almost there.
It's a long story Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here catch this!
What are you doing over there?
I know Andy's excited about Buzz but you know he'll always have a special place for you.
Uh let what?  I don't -- Uh what do you mean?  Who?
Well sure look at him.  He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.
You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
Heh heh...oh yeah uh I...
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
Oh hey - it was nothing.
I wanted to thank you Woody for saving my flock.
Aach! -- Oh hi Bo.
Now Buzz what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!
Me?  No no no no...  Are you?
We're not aiming for the truck!
Uh Buzz?!  We missed the truck!
Ha ha!!  To Infinity and Beyond!!
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
Hey Buzz!!  You're flying!!
Not today!
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
Ha-ha!!
Hold still Buzz!
Woody?!  What are you doing?
The match!
Woody!  The rocket!
Great!
Look out!!
Well thanks for the ride.
NO-O-O-O-O-O-O!!
I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
Hold on Woody!
Woody!
Nice work fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius.
It's ok.  Everything's under control.
What?!
Shhhhhhh!
We've got to get out of here...NOW.
Woody!  It's the moving van.
Yes Sir!
Come on Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --
Why would Andy want you?!  Look at you!  You're a Buzz Lightyear.  Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.  You've got wings you glow in the dark you talk your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy.
But why would Andy want me?
No it is.  Look over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest and it's not because you're a Space Ranger pal it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
Yeah right.
Whoa hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
No Woody for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
Oh Buzz you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
Why sure you can Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
Oh come on Buzz.  I...Buzz I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
Come on this way!
Out the window...Buzz you're a genius!
But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much it's not my color...
Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet Buzz.
Oh I'm a sham!!
Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here Buzz.
One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
What happened to you?
Shhh!
Don't tell me what to do!
Another stunt like that cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
Sorry guys but dinner's canceled!
Woody stop it!!
Back!  Back you savages!  Back!
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
Oh you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!
It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --
Shield your eyes!
They're gonna eat us Buzz!!  Do something!  Quick!
I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
Woody we don't know what's out there!
Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Oh great great.  Yeah and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
What's gotten into you Sheriff?  I was --
Alright Buzz get ready...
Spaceship.
Where is it?  I don't see the --
C'mon c'mon that's it...
Hyper-active hyperdrive and astro...uh turf.
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Wait a minute!  No Buzz!  This way! There's a special ship.  I just saw it!
Sorry.
Ow!  Watch where you're going!
Negative.  There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  We'll be much safer in the cockpit.
No no no wait Buzz Buzz let's get in the back.  No one will see us there.
Well then let's climb abroad.
Uh-huh.  And when we get there we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
Go away.
Buzz!  Buzz come back!
WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
Oh yeah?  Well if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost Andy is gone they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
Sheriff this is no time to panic.
Shut up!  Just shut up you idiot!!
According to my nava-computer the --
No.
But we're not on my planet are we?
Oh.  Oh that's good.
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
Right?  Buddy?
Then we've no time to lose!!
Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped Buzz!
Trouble?!  Where?!
Buzz!!  Oh Buzz Buzz Lightyear!! Buzz Lightyear thank goodness! We've got trouble!
Buzz I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
I could have stopped him.
You mean that happy child?
THAT is Sid!
No!  No that's Scud you idiot!
Sure is a hairy fellah.
That's why.  Sid.
Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
I'd better take a look anyway.
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
What's going on?
Where?
Oh no no no...  Buzz look!  An alien!
You're mocking me aren't you?
You actually think you're THE "Buzz Lightyear?" Oh all this time I thought it was an act!  Hey guys!  Look!  It's the REAL Buzz Lightyear!
Oh yeah tough guy?!
Don't even think about it cowboy!
Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay so you want to do it the hard way huh?
And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.
What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
Listen Lightsnack you stay away from Andy.  He's mine and no one is taking him away from me.
That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
Why thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
All right then I will.  Stand back everyone!
Okay then Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
I tell you I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Can't!  Can't!  Can't!
Can!
You can't!
Yes I can.
No you can't.
They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly.
Excuse me.
He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
Excuse me I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
T-O-Y.  Toy.
Toy?
Alright everyone.  You're clear to come up.
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
Watch yourself!!
Well let's see we've got double A's --
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
Yes it is a mistake because you see the bed here is my spot.
HO-YAAAHH!!!
Hello-o-o...
So you see?  We're friends now guys.  Aren't we Buzz?  You bet.  Gimme a hug.
Something's screwy here.
Everyone it's Woody!
Hi!
Oh what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
Oh impressive wingspan.  Very good!
What's with him?
It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
Plus is positive minus is negative! Oh let me!
Eh he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
No no!  Turn 'em around turn 'em around!
Stay calm everyone!!
Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
It doesn't matter how much we're played with.  What matters is that we're here for Andy when he needs us.  That's what we're made for. Right? Everyone is now looking down sheepish.
Murderer!
Oh that is disgusting.
He's in the psycho's bedroom!
Son of a building block it's Woody!
How 'bout three out of five?
No no not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!
Oh quit your whining and pay up.
Are you peeking?
Heh-heh.
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
Miss.  G-6.

How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
Will you quit moving around?!
Aa-a-a-a-ah! 
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
He tortures toys -- just for fun.
That ain't no happy child.
Oh uh Mr. Lightyear?  Now I'm curious.  What does a Space Ranger actually do?
Gettin' kind of tense aren't you?
And I'm from Mattel.  Well I'm not actually  from Mattel I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. Well I don't really understand the financials but...
Oh really?  I'm from Playskool.
Have you been replaced?
Well that MISTAKE is sitting in your spot Woody.
Outta my way!  Here I come here I come --
Where's my ear?  Who's seen my ear? Did you see my ear?
Oh ya big lizard!  Now we'll never know what it is!
Oh no!
No no no wait!
Toss 'im overboard!
No wait!  You don't understand! Buzz is out there!  We've gotta help him!!
Come on.  Let's get out of here.
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us please!  You don't know what it's like over here!
Save it for the jury.  I hope Sid pulls your voice-box out ya creep!
No it's not what you think I swear!
You murdering dog!
No!  No no no no!
Nothing.
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
No I'm not!  Buzz come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.
You are a liar!
No no no!  You got it all wrong Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
Did you all take stupid pills this morning?!  Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?  And now you want to let him back over here?
Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
Good going Slink!  Now just just tie it on to something!
Now it was an accident!  Guys c'mon now you...you gotta believe me
That's Mr. Potato Head to you you back-stabbin' murderer!
Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window do you Potato Head?
I can't tell.  Hey where's Lenny?
Who is it this time?
Alright!  That's it!
Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh heh...
All right that's enough.  Look we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy --
Laser-envy.
A lunchbox...?!
A lunchbox?!
Of course Woody ain't worried! He's been Andy's favorite since kindergarten!
Well obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried.
Yeah hey Buzz.  Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake.  Gimme five man!
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
Hi ya fellas.  To infinity and beyond!
Hey Woody!?  Where'd ya go?
Ha ha.  That's very funny Buzz.  This is serious!!
Hey these guys are professionals. They're the best.  C'mon they're not lying down on the job.
Shouldn't they be there by now? What's taking them so long?!
Okay save your batteries!
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
If I send out the troops will you all calm down?
Hey listen no one's getting replaced.  This is Andy we're talking about.
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
C'mon guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
I was close to being scared that time.
Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
Oh how ya doin' Rex?
ROOAAAARR!!!
He got it Woody!
I got it Woody!
There aren't any more!  That's the whole barrel.
It's too short!  We need more monkeys!
Oh I don't like confrontations.
We believe you Woody.  Right Rex?
I thought he was at summer camp!
It's Sid!
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
What the heck is up there?
Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
They're getting bigger.
I can't quite make out -- 
Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried are you?
Andy's coming everybody!  Back to your places.  Hurry!
Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
There.
So did I tell ya?  Huh?  Nothing to worry about.
Mission accomplished.  Well done men.  Pack it up we're going home.

Last present!
Okay we're on the last present now...

Okay thank you.  At ease.

Somebody's poisoned the water hole...
What?!
This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
Huh?
Reach for the sky!!

This is ludicrous.
Just stay where you are Corporal! Don't move Carl.  You'll blow up. I know you're tired!  I know your leg is cramping but you can't move. Do you hear me?
Oh no...it's a Combat Carl.
Uh-oh.
Yessss!  Ah ha ha ha...
Slink!  Hang on!
I can't hold on much longer!
Speed up!
Woody!  Speed up!
See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights Potato Head.
Ha ha oh I love you too.
I knew you'd come back Woody!
Boy am I glad to see you guys!
We're gonna get outta here Buzz -- Buzz?
Woody?!
Oh shut up!  In a couple of days everything will be just the way it was.  They'll see... they'll see. I'm still Andy's favorite toy.
Heh heh heh!  Golly bob howdy --
Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited that's all.  Too much cake and ice cream I suppose.  It's just a mistake.
Woody what are you doing under the bed?
Got it.
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
Sh-h-h-h-h!!
Bad news?!
Not now Slink.  I've got some bad news.
Oh...well alright you can be red if you want.
No Slink --

Right here Woody!
Hey Slinky?
