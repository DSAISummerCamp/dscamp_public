Officers there's your killer do your duty arrest him!
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught we are sent to mental hospital...
I don't think it's abuse I think it's torture.
I'm abused.  Don't you think?
Can I see your back?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.
Yeah he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Yeah yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Back in the Czech Republic?
Yeah she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Your mother was blind?
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Tell me about yourself.  What you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
Give me another one please.
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
What else do you need?
This is not about money Emil.  I need your trust in me.
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
But it's...
No.  No way.
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
What's your cut?  How much?
Look I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
No he is here.  Shit...
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
What about Oleg?
Well you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
I was all of these.
...delusions and paranoia.
Oh sure.
You bring the cigarettes?
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes another sent a check. Another wants a check.
I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
Yes.  Yes come with me!
I'm coming with you.
Where are we going?
Don't say anything.
He has the camera!  He took the movie!
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
Oh no!  No!  Shit!
Here.  I have your money.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Are you my attorney?  I'm Emil.  I'm insane.
Daphne I...
I don't want to drag you down with me.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
Pouring it out!
What are you doing?
I'll get my clothes.
I'll make some for us.
In the kitchen.
Do you have coffee?
Right.
You better get packed.
I'm glad I met you.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
If you were my boyfriend I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
If I was your boyfriend I might be.
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
Is he your boyfriend?
I'm sorry.
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
Are you alright?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
They're not gonna send you right back.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
I know.
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
What are you asking me?
So you were never a prostitute?
I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
No.
What about back home?
No.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
Yes I considered it.
You considered becoming a prostitute?
Yeah.  This way.
So...the station is empty?
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
Somewhere else?
I can't take you to my place.
Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
Divorced.
Are you married?
They won't until this is over.
I will if they don't send me back.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
Now I become custody of police department?
Yes but he was a cop.
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
Look we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
A cop?
No no don't talk to Immigration!
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
If I tell you will you arrest me?
Whether you tell us or not we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
Go on.
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken she let me use theirs.
C'mon start at the beginning.  You know these people?
I told your partner I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
Yeah sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
Look after Jordy briefs me you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
Well I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
It was my decision not his.
Oh.
There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.
But Chief?  Over this??
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page as a hero this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
End my career?
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
Okay.  But not water sports.
Chief - mind if I take her?
Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
No!  Nothing happened.
A shower!?  Did you take one too?
I let her take a shower.
What do you mean 'cleaned up?'
Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
Hey Chief what are you doing here?
'Cause we got more important things to do like finding out who did it.
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
Who do you think Chief?!
Who did cause and origin?
Yeah.
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
You do that wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
I said yeah you're right Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
What was that Korfin?
Yeah right.
Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry we'll get those fuckers.
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
No.  I'm okay.
Are you hit?
Stay with her.
The other side of the street.  The guy with the videocamera.  Don't look - put her in the car.  Stay this side.
C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
Yeah.
Only one guys checked in?
It's okay.
Sorry...PD only.
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
Any I.D.?
Takin' a bath.
Where is she?
A timer.
What's he looking for?
You ready?
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
When?
I'm gonna propose.
What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
It was freaky I'll tell you.  Stupid kid.
Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
Vodka tonic.
Coffee for me I gotta slow down.
She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
Tall short-haired scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
Describe him.
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her too.
What are you saying?
Boy she's so popular all the sudden.
Did you tell him you did?
No.
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there you know it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
We don't have her I.D. yet but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
What's wrong?
Homicide Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Who's there?
You know I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time but I still kept him.
Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that?
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there they know your face.  And the little fame the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
But I mean didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
Well it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand that's why you're a professional.
I told you you know I thought I was doing the right thing you know I think she's innocent.
No I don't think you were a fool I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean to say the least you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
Yeah just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up but...
Just a shower?
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Well you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
Look Eddie I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
Hey.  I'm a professional.
Okay tell you what I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
You know what I'm saying here.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
So am I.
I'm serious here.
My point exactly.
I don't have a girlfriend.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
Yeah.
You wanna talk to her alone?
Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.
Raw deal.
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
Something back home?
Why not?
Is that all there is?
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid
Then I guess we're doin' this the right way aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire kick in the door rush into the smoke and save a kid.
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door kicking it in pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
Of course.
So am I.  Alright I'll go inside and you cover the back.
I'm on duty.
You thirsty?
I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
Better than one.
Two heads.
I'll call it... tails.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win you don't come.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
I'll let you know what happens.
But what if it does?  You might need my help.
This has nothing to do with your fire.
Mind if I ride along with you?
You got any better ideas?
You goin' to the escort service?
Stay here.
My folks are.
You're Polish?
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
This isn't homicide school.
I can watch you Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
I'll come with you.
Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally.
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up no proper funeral it's like condemning them to hell.
Look I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
What would you call her?
Who says she's a suspect?
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Hmmmm.
Pretty.
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
You were right they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off too.  What about the report?
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
Did you get a report from the M.E.?
Good.  Good.  Commendable.
I don't even watch TV.
Nah why should you?
Well just so you know I don't care about that stuff.
Well just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
Nah I musta missed it.
Watch the news?
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
Why don't you explain it Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?
No what is it?
You know what that is right?
No we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
Hey that's great you guys got it all wrapped up but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
Then do it asshole.
I kill someone famous.
What's your accomplishment.
Your opinion.  You see they going to make a movie about me too Eddie.  And write books.
What do you want?
So...who's Nicky?
Don't be late.
Thank you.
See you later.  Good luck.
Okay.
Yeah yeah.  Good thing.
Okay.  And you know what I'll swing by my place grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
Yeah.  I promise.
You promise?
Tonight.
Okay til tonight.
I love you.
Patronizing you... Nay I love you.
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead just imagine that uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
Promise?
I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
No.  No listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know the shoe thing and the marriages and...
No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now we're in the middle of something here.
Well that's great.
Yeah.
That's good.
Oh my G-d they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight!
Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for a second.  They only call me when it's an emergency.  Just hold that thought.  Can you call back?
Answer it.
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
Answer the phone.
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
Jesus.  And last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  What am I going to do with you?
Could be Leon's.
Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?
You're not so bad yourself.
You're ruthless.
Well who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
Yeah well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
I'm not.
Alright alright Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Maybe I should just ya know...turn to the cameras and say do you mind if we just work something out?
Stop it.
Oh I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you sweetheart?  Oh...
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
Hey.
Hey honey.
Okay.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright?
Alright.
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Eddie are you okay?
Alright cut cut cut.
Um...now is not a good time okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Do you have the suspect in custody?
He was hurt but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
I understand but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
Is it drug related?
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
There are two bodies found at this point.
How many victims are up there?
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
Detective does it look like a murder?
Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
Any chance we can do that again?
Yeah yeah.  Jesus.
Okay.  You ready?
Keep them out of my way.
Ready?
You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
I hope this prick doesn't run.  My knees are killing me.  Stay behind me.
Yeah.  And he still went to the party.
That's unique.
He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
Not what.  Who.
So what's unique?
My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life they make you a better person they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right Leon?
How old are your kids?
I'm not moody.
I think you're getting a little moody there Eddie.
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
Sooner or later that's everybody.
Jesus Christ.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
No.  Are you proposing?
Are you married?
Dog food.
And what do you do with the bones?
You stuff sausage in it.
You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
I am butcher.
Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that.  And what kind of work do you do?
Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk about surrendering.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
Tell him to put his gun down!
The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
Where's your partner?
Get down on your knees.
C'mon.  Pull the trigger.  Do it.  Oh look you're sweating.  You don't have the balls.
You'll be my first.
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
Tommy take a walk.
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
Alright alright - don't hurt me! Please it's in my book in my purse!
Give me the address!!
Look man I don't give a shit if you want sex or not but you're payin' for my time.
Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.
Look.  Do we have a problem here? There's no reason to have a problem. I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You wanna Czech girl? After I'm done with you you won't miss her.  Now why don't you pay me?
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
Where is escort service?
It's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  I don't meet the other girls.  Aren't you gonna get undressed?
I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne you know her?
Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
Baby I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl I'm mommy I'm a Czech girl.
Where's Czech girl?
Hi I'm Honey.
He doesn't speak English.
I'd like to speak for himself okay?
Two weeks.
How long are you planning to stay?
We are both from Prague.
No you're travelling together.  I want to talk to you together.  Hi how are you?  Can I take a look at your documents?  Are you related?
Is there a problem?
Please join us.  Come on forward.
Yes.
Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
Can you show me?  Sir no cameras in the FIS area!
I have five-hundred dollars.
How much money are you carrying with you?
Two weeks holiday.
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
Yes sir.
Next.  Could I see your documents please?
Yes.  Both.
Hey tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look you want magazine or not?
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
In here says he wants a million.
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
This all you want?
New York's finest.  This is his case.
Who is he?
No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
Traitor!!
You think you are a director?  You are a fucking little small Russian piece of shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate you.
No I don't get that!
You got that?
Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
Credit?
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize if it wasn't for my film for my talent my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
Be quiet.  Watch.
I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
Shut up.  Look!
I'm serious.
The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
In movie they make of us who do you think would act me?
Oleg don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
Cut!
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
Good idea!
No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free rich and famous!
This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.
Sit down!
Let me get a shot of it.
What does it look like?  It's an address book!
What is that?
Put the camera down Oleg.
Why not?
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either did you?  Don't lie I won't be angry.
I did.
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
What is it?
Don't want to film this?
Oh shit.  I hate looking at that!
Does it hurt?
Shut up.
Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
Oleg get in bathroom stay there and shut up!
Whatever we do - we fuck her right?
Get in the bathroom!
I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
Whore?
I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
How you erase this?
You said speak Czech!
Speak English!
I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
Turn that fucking thing off!
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
What?
For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so.  Unless you refuse Oleg.
Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
Turn that off!  Get the bags.
We have no money.  Come on.
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Don't speak Russian!
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
I want to document my trip to America.
Did you hear what I said?
Okay.
Don't fool around.
Okay.
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
We started over you can too.
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
It's easy to learn.
As a plumber?!
Yes the money is good.
A job?
I can get you a job.
Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!
Ha. Ha.
We spent it!
Milos.  Get my money!
Take your eyes off her Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
Did you hurt her?
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
Surprise!  Surprise!
Emil???!
You want the tape?  There it is!
Viewer discretion advised!
Trust me you'll want to take this call.
I can't talk to anybody right now can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
You've got a call.
What are you doing here?
Robert...?
Don't give me that fucking shit.
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries they'll convict him.
And you you'll pay for what you did!
Paulie you've got kids right?
Yeah?
In love?  With who?
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
Isn't he a little moody?
Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
Alright.  Go ahead.
I'm trying to tell you.
I want to hear everything he said.
Well he...
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
I know.
Excuse me?
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
I'm here for movies.
What are you coming here to do?
A cheap hotel.
Yes we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
New York.
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
I speak English.
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
Yes...he's my friend.
He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
Well he killed my partner!
He's my collar!
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
No way!  He's mine!
I'll take him.
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
What was that?
Yeah well some people got their priorities straight.
And while they're burning up they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
That's what it looks like to me.
So the way you see it two crack heads burned themselves up?
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
No.  Go ahead.
Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here.
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
You okay?
Hey.  C'mon you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
I'll send a cop back for you.
Oh yeah?  Guess again.
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
Okay you're under arrest!  Now you happy?
Alright how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
Look I don't have time for you get out of my way!!
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
Hey by the way I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
Yeah?  What kind?
I used an accelerant.
How did you start the fire this time?
Yeah I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now are you guys gonna arrest me or not?
What's that on your forehead Max? That's a nice attention getter.
They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!
What the hell happened?
Get outta here!
Not good.
How was it?
Lay down.  Stay down Bobby.
It hurts.  Aw Jesus!
Bobby Bobby!  Where're you hit?!
If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
Aren't you tired?
You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
You hear that question Garcia?
How long they been livin' here?
-- From Czechoslovakia?  And how long have they been livin' in your building?  Alright I'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  Milos and Tamina Karlova.  They were quiet and kept to themselves.  Landlord don't know who your girl is.
Maybe you can be his stand-in.
Yeah?
Now that you know him maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
What?
That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
What??
He knew all along.
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
But you knew that right?
The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run.
Don't blow your nose!
Clean?
Mouth's clean too.
Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
Nah not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
Oh yeah why?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
I don't know you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
Where you been man?  We got a celebrity!
GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU TOO!!!
Look you can't shoot him in cold blood.
Take the car.  Get outta here Tommy.
Don't stoop to his level!
Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
What are you gonna do?
The clerk?
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't convicted.
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
We're in negotiations that's correct.
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
Look I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it jump started your career as an artist?
Look I'm a victim here too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
It was my finger that pulled the trigger but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Your doctor?
This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who as you know made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.
Now you tell us.
Sometimes a wound will kill.
This is healing?
Jim Younger I told you--
I couldn't lose him.
Tom I'm this close to coming with you...
I think I may just go on to the reservation.
I said like a Comanche not this Comanche.
You can ride like that?
It's tougher than it looks.
He's not bad at it.
Things changed when you quit the gang. For example I'm now the one who says "Let's ride."
You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
I'm sorry Cole.
Swear on Jimmy's grave.
I swear --
Swear.
Bob. I didn't...
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
I ain't done --
What have you done?
How'd they --
Leave me alone Bob.
Cole we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job if you know what I mean.
As long as people think Jesse's still riding we will never get the respect we deserve.
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
This is the best score yet.
What?
That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick.
Frankly yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
We got a problem here brother?
Say we bust into a bank. We yell "We're the Younger-James Gang!" People are gonna be thinking "The younger James Gang? Is there an older James Gang? How come we never heard of the older James gang?" So people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms.
How?
No Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.
You stay out of this Bob.
Uhh yeah it does.
Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.
I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
Our place Clell Miller's Sammy Johnston the Creeders. Will Hite.
Zee I'm pleased you came.
Here's Liberty's favorite son!  I'll never forget what you did cousin.
That was two hours ago.
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.
Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
Never a good thing.
He's smiling.
Dammit this stopped being fun about two years ago!
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
Tomorrow.
The Army can hang him.
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
Damn!
He just lost his temper a little.
Oh no...
They came up made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off one of those detectives hit him in the head knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.
Stop by our spread after that tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
Cole I want to get to the farm make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.
... Will Perry ...
Jesus mercy that's Charlie Higgins Dave Laller ...
Then I love it.
Nope.
Corn gonna shoot at me?
Well somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
Yesterday.
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
My plan of lying here pissing myself seems to be working mighty fine thank you.
Tell me.
Listen he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
What?
He's planning a job.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
Listen Jesse we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
You are a fine figure of a man.
The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...
Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
This is about the "Wanted!" Posters isn't it.
You heard me Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
Beg pardon?
One false move and I'll blow your heads off!
Okay folks I think we know how this is going to go...
"Bank officials estimate the loss at fifty thousand dollars."
Hey!
"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."
We oughta take some of this give it to our neighbors in Liberty. Lot of people hurting up there.
Well no Jesse it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
All right settle down. All this money ain't ours.
Exactly.
But if we take their money and supplies...
Not yet. But I'm hoping.
You have no shame.
Two.
How many of them did he kill?
Best damn plan I heard all war.
Home. We go home. We ride like hell to get there and we kill anything or anyone that comes between us and our homes. And when we get there we stay there and God help any fool who tries to get me to leave my farm again.
No really. You're wife said she needed some help seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --
You shut up now boy.
I think I saw you leavin' by the front door just as I was coming in the back.
How?
I think I recognize you.
What you sayin' boy?
You ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
What?
We didn't. Zerelda did. Turns out your wife makes a hell of an outlaw.
Where'd you get all these riders?
Pff. All we been through the thought never crossed my mind.
You know you gettin' caught right after leaving us some people thought --
Missed you too cousin.
Missed you cousin.
Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
WHAT?! We follow you for a year and now that our blood's been spilled you're gonna quit?!
I'm out.
We'll make them pay for this.
Pass me some whisky.
Bob rip up some bandages.
Clell Tom go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
Okay you're gonna rest here.
A trap.
Dammit!
You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend cousin.  Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich!
Fine. We hit this bank.
Then let me run the show General Lee.
Still smells fishy.
And I'm the better outlaw.
I'm the better soldier Jesse.
That's it.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
I got us through the War all right.
A bad idea.
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
Beautiful.
You're forgetting who's in charge --
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town and I know this bank and I say it's an easy job.
What are you saying?
If you'd read about it first you'd have no problems.
Smells funny it being mentioned in the paper.
What will be?
It'll be the biggest score yet.
Hold on hold on we all know Bob is an important part of the gang.
This is your fault for hogging all the publicity.
Why aren't we the "Younger-James Gang"? I mean there's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here.
Yep.
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
Sure cousin.
Jesse we got to have a word.
Twenty?!
"The Fidelity Bank and Trust was robbed on Tuesday by a gang of twenty heavily armed men."
It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.
It's not a bank.
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
See Frank's being smart about this.
I got three.
I got seven thousand.
Don't let it happen again.
Sorry.
The James-Younger Gang.
Let's ride.
Perfect Cole.
I'll pick the first job! I mean... I know a girl down at the bank. See if she can't get a list of towns where the railroad keeps its money.
Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men they won't care.
So what do we do General Lee?
This isn't a feud this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives they can replace 'em in a day.
Yeah.
Because we were good at it?  Hell we were great at it. Jesse don't tell anyone I said this because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
But it was a whole lot of killing. Why should we miss that?
It was exciting.
The war? What are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it don't you Jesse?
Thanks for the help.
All right calm down. I'll agree Sadie was a woman --
She was European!
She had a moustache.
She got two of them.
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
In case we have to kill these sonofabitches I don't want them to see us coming.
What is wrong with you?
Not now.
Pick your fights cousin. You taught me that.
You're not scared are you?
Hands off your hip Cole.
Planting corn. Harvesting corn. Year after year.
Home boys. Back to our farms.
There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
Where you boys going?
Suit yourself. We'll have some horses waiting for you at the road.  Let's ride Rangers!
I could use the walk.
Ride with me cousin?
What's going on?
'Bout time you got here buddy.
I'm thinking...
Well?
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack or work for you...
Tom why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you if you want.
You ride like a Comanche.
Wait'll we get back to Missouri start telling those gals about how little Jesse James charged the whole Union Army by himself!
You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be Tom.
They're just insurance in case we run.
They gonna rush us?
Another dozen out back.
Cole he didn't mean that.
Oh you're in charge? We ain't partners any more Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
Jesse.
-- Exactly. Because this is a war.
Strategically.
Hey! We decide something that's it! We're in this for the long haul and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
Get buckets!
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
Ah.
Shakespeare.  He's European.
I have no idea what you just said but it sounded real nice.
Sadie was not a man!
Oh Lord the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
The brown one.
Which one right or left?
I think one of 'em's glass.
Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory boys.
What the --
Soon as I hit one the other'll know and beat us up.
Both would be nice.
Cannon or Gatling?
All right all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
This here is the Younger Gang!
Where is Jesse James?
What?
Of course!  Uh sir?
The safe. Now.
Me get heap firewater --
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
Ho-yah!
East? East above the river heading for the Eagle Pass?
Ho-yah. Him say tell Big Lawman in Carville that badman Jesse James riding toward Rising Sun above Great River near Eagle Rock.
Of St. Louis?
The District Marshall
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
Yeah Injun. What do you want?
You 'um big lawman?
I'd appreciate that.
Fine. I'll just wait here.
It's a secret.
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
On account of we're robbing it.
Then why can't I go in there?
You're right sir.
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
Shit.
I had you covered.  From back there.
Where the hell were you?
When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?
So?
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
What is it?
What the --
It's fine by me Jesse.
Yesss but I was thinking I could come by and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
You know you're welcome any time!
Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
What do you say sir?
Go home Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
Boys...
Died a hero.
Web died fighting?
Pff. He jumped his horse clear over our heads killed a dozen Union soldiers before they knew what hit them.
My little Web did that?
-- rode right into them screaming like a banshee.
I'm upset too Zee but Jesse and Cole know what they're doing. I'm sure they won't press their luck.
He thinks this is some kind of game!
I think he's already feeling better.
Well I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
They're gone. What are you --
The bullet came out clean but he lost a whole lot of blood. Praying wouldn't hurt.
He's going to be fine right Daddy?
Zerelda it's no coincidence. The railroad men come through offering to buy up land. Nobody sells. Then they start hanging men who own farms for treason?
Daddy don't start with this again.
Hell they hardly even noticed us.
See you soon. Oh and I appreciate the distraction back there.
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
Yeah.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
Railroad burned him out too. You couldn't have stopped him.
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
Jim was old enough...
Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.
Got any ideas little brother?
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
No I --
You taking sides against me now Frank?
Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad.
Oh yeah.
We're drunk.
A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
What do you want me to say Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
We're doing this for Ma.
I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
That's a lie. You could've bought a dozen farms with the money we've stolen.
If I could go back to farming --
You've killed your fair share of men.
It got to you didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
And we're good at it.
Jesse we're outlaws.
This has been a good year.
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing and he's the best shot in the gang.
Pardon the delay folks but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
The posters?
Bob's upset.
Gents we are in the middle of something here.
It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
And it's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
And that's why you both lead the gang. Two of you went into that bank together right?
And I planned getting you off the hangman's deck --
We're gonna have to talk...
Fine. How'd it go out here?
How'd it go in there?
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
Don't care.
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
Ma.
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
Shut up.  Uh Doc I was wondering if uh this evening I could come by?
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
Would you get in the carriage? Until Ma has you home so she can fuss over you herself she's gonna make me miserable.
What do you think?
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
Damn. All that reading paid off.
I went up to the courthouse and looked at the right of way documents for the rail bed. The railroad doesn't even need our land they're just taking the land on both sides for as far as they can.
Heard of him.
You know him?
Your Zee? Hmm.  "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books the arts the academes that show contain and nourish all the world."
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
She's still talking to Jesus.
Next time try "fat and haggard."
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
You are a charmer.
You can shut up now.
"Big and older"?
Maybe maybe...
That just might work.
What kind of story are they going to believe?
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it we should be all right.
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay fine by me.
Saved all our lives Doc. None of the Liberty boys would have come home if not for Web Mimms Doc. God's honest truth.
Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself.
Zee we got to talk to you and your father.
You're doing just fine.
Frank don't you have something to say?
We better go to Doc's see what's going on here.
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
All this time in the saddle... We get to the farm I'm going to shoot this damn horse just on principle.
Hello Liberty Missoura!
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Hell of a war.
I reckoned.
Web's dead.
No Jesse your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
See that's your problem Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff I'm already finished doing it.
I figure.
That would have made an impression.
You could have worn one of those big floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
Such as?
Mm-hmm.
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
Distracting enough for you?
So we got a plan?
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling they try to shoot it off.
Everything but the boring parts.
How much of that story is true?
Yeah Jimmy?
Uncle Frank?
I think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around.
So what was he?
Can't argue that.
But he killed a lot of men too.
Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
They're making him a hero now.
That he was.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age you've got enough painful memories you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom riding off into a new life growing old together happy.
...every time you tell that story you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
Yeah Jimmy?
Y'know Uncle Frank...
Shush.
Doc Mimms will --
Take care of each other boys. You say your prayers.
We know Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
Riders --
Boys?
Ma! Please!
Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard nobody'll ever find them.
We're just fine thank you sir.
Easterners.
He's a good Christian and he killed Yankees. Jesus told me that made him an all right boy.
Ma I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.
Say your prayers?
A fair number Ma.
Did you kill Yankees?
I'll explain on the way.
Tennessee?
Yes ma'am.
Don't swear.
You are a hell of a woman.
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
Yes ma'am.
You get arrested again I'll kill you.
If you don't see it it's not real...
What?
Don't turn around.
Swimming. Swimming is good.
Stop it. This is just sad.
Aw shucks ma'am...
Jesse have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble your accent gets all farm boy?
Now sweetie y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels would you?
Oh I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
Let me see that.
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
I beg your pardon?
"But the life of the James Gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies... especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse James."
"Hmm" what?
Hmm.
Now wait a minute. There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding.
I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
Are you going to be happy here Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
I don't understand.
I had to see you. I'm getting married.
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
Zee.
When my name makes them cry in their sleep. When I've brought them to ashes.
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
Let the law --
Me neither.
You and I we've started... something you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.
Frank and me have to go away for a while.
I am so sorry Jesse.
I've been planning on kissin' you for a very long time.
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Yep.
Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
Little ones.
Sparkling rocks?
Ahem. "From this doctrine..." No ah... "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive they sparkle still like ... shiny... sparkling rocks..."
Honestly you'd do if only you had the buck teeth.
Where will you find such a girl?
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
And what's this right girl like?
Not if I find the right girl.
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life Jesse James?
Mostly. It would be an all right life for a bachelor.
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that didn't you?
Arr. Hand over your jewels Missy.
A river pirate.
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
You didn't want to farm?
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.
Unfair. You are completely unfair.
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
I wasn't the only one risking my neck that day.
Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero.
What?
I shouldn't tease a hero.
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing I mean.
Teasing you is completely unfair.
No! I mean of course not. No.
You're sick of my company?
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
You shouldn't be up.
Nuh-huh ...
Jesse is that your hand?
Mmmm.
Jesse are you awake?
If there's anything we can do for you Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
But still died.
But you got big!
You were little Jesse James when you left.
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
Fair enough.
I'd just as soon kill you Jesse James. But chasing you takes up too much of my time.
Thanks.
The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.
He's too important James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
No I'll hang you.  But I may miss you just a bit.
Ahh you'll miss me.
You cocky little bastard.
I'm not hanged yet.
That's what I would have done.
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
Was it worth it?
I figured.
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you you know.
No that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one.
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there shooting at me.
Damn.
The cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town.
Yes?
You had all those cattle there so I'd think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive?
Mmm.
Last February?
How did you spot the ambush in Torrell?
Pity.
You almost ended my career before it began.
Not that day. I am guilty of many things but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker that day.
Did you order our houses burned down?
That's the idea.
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
Oh it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
But I like the presidential suite.
We're moving you tomorrow.
Communion.
Right here in church?
Now let's have a drink.
Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.
Thank you.
Discretion? Sir I am a man of the cloth.
I could have lied I suppose but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?
You don't think God'll mind do you?
This is unusual. Most of our marriages are members of the congregation.
You're gonna tell her when you're resting up in bed with her Jimmy.
Jesse you explain to Lyla. My girl you know from that time...
This time we'll make an exception.
... too young for whisky...
It's his money.  He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains don't you Jesse?
What about that Rock Island bastard?
You do that.
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
I swear.
You and Frank and Cole and even Bob get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone okay Jesse?
I think so.
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh not exactly. It's just I don't want to get one of these paid ladies you know?
You been with a girl ever?
Well not exactly.
Tonight? Why I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
Jim you been with a girl yet?
I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole. Now it's my turn.
I guess so.
Not too young to shoot a man not to young to drink.
Yeah. Hey are you drinking whisky? You're too young to be drinking whisky.
You okay Jesse?
No.
I like that.
And the same age Web was. No.
I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
And you're too young.
Don't talk about it much though.
Really?
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
That is so gentlemanly of you.
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
Gosh that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Lyla Devereux.
Thank you Miss -- ?
I just though you were awful cute.
Not at all.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Really?
Yes but just so I could find out who you were.
Oh you were talking to Jesse.
I hope you don't mind Jesse James told me your name.
Why yeah.
Move you fools!
There's only four of them...
They donate money to farmers to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
How can that be?
By burning down their homes?
They had to be dealt with!
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.
Relax Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.
I'm doing you folks a favor --
Well this land is about to be condemned.
Not such a menace now is he Pinkerton?
How did you know?
I remember you.
This is him.
Oh that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
That.
What sir?
What is that?
Sir?
Parker.
I look forward to seeing it.
The final route for the railroad is complete.
We should go burn that school to the ground sir!
With my money!
What is going on here man?
Your men knew the risks.
We did.
THEN WHO DID?!
To be precise they didn't blow up the tracks.
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
Thirty-five thousand sir. Coins and currency. And the delay from the miles of destroyed track --
How much did they get from the safe?
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.
I'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress.
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power we may move with impunity.
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
Just perfect.
Yes sir.
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
Unfortunately not sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
Good.
Two weeks ago we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
Parker tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars not necessarily in that order.
I can completely understand your distress sir.
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
Really!
And it is my pleasure to be here.
Mr. Thaddeus Rains sir it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.
Vengeance.
What the hell is that sound?
Why their intense hatred of you of course.
What is that?
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
Can you put men at all four?
There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
In English Pinkerton.
Every three months the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
No.
So he's won.
It's going to be a long spring.
Can't you tell me anything?
No you demand results. They are not the same thing. And if you want results you will let me do my job as I see fit. Unless of course  You want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it?
I demand action.
Yes that's the way to win the locals back to our side.
And there are some towns in Missouri where James and his men can walk openly as heroes.
I can't believe this.
First of all: you shut up.  Now you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land too many riverbeds to ride caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
All of the James Gang's encounters have been with local law enforcement who quite frankly are no match for this group's cunning.
Pinkerton. It's been eight months. I see robberies. I see hold ups. But I do not see men on the end of nooses.
It's going to be a long winter.
So you can't tell me anything?
Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage tactics and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band this gang is what I would create.
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
It's early in the game yet Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves feeling out each other's patterns.
Oh that's the best part.
"The gang made off with thirty-five thousand dollars and also destroyed the Thaxton Switch construction meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land!"  Who wrote this!? I'll see him hanged every Tuesday for a month!
It is a nice piece of writing.
"A Rock Island and Pacific Railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside St. Louis Missouri. The brave and daring James-Younger Gang was heavily outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the West."
I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
This is no game.
Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here Mr. Rains.
I want them arrested and hanged!
Oh no I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them too.
You wouldn't have done that?
Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
Look at this Pinkerton! They got the payroll and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
Bourne comes here? Why?
He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now.  You'll have to hurry.
What?
Save it for Bourne.
Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
What do you mean?
Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich come enjoy it.
One last push. One.
Neski was a roadblock. Without me there's no company no fortune. You owe me Uri. One last push.
Anything else?
She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
And the Landy woman?
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
Will it track back to us?
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
There was a mistake.
You told me Bourne was dead.
Well you're probably right. I guess that's all that hubris is.
No. You lost your way.
In the end honestly it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are.
No good options left?
Had to be done.
And Danny Zorn what was that?
Why not? It was just money.
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry.
'Why' would be enough for me.
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
Sit down.
I'm sorry Ward.
Jesus... I Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
Don't know.
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
No... It must have been Bourne.
Did he say anything to you?
Oh God... It must have been Bourne.
They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
What?
I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
Sorry to wake you.
Well whatever he's doing I've had enough -- this is now a search and destroy mission.  I want the Berlin police fully briefed and --  -- get this out to all the agencies.
It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
So what's he doing? You believe him?
There are no answers. There's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead. And I for one would prefer the latter. And what about her?  You just send her out to this lunatic with no protection?
Don't you want answers?
My ass he does. You're playing with fire Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
Hold on -- he said he wants to come in.
Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers DOD whatever they got. Snipers?
And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him...
You don't know what you're getting into here.
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
Berlin!
So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
What's definitive is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
Conklin might've been a nut but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days I'll prove he killed Lincoln.  This is supposed to be definitive?
May I finish?
We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark.
Excuse me.
Do you know what his budget was?
...At the time of his death Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars.
...this is Conklin's computer.
...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...
I think I do. We had a deal going down in Berlin last week. During the buy both our Field Agent and the seller were killed. We pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that didn't go off.  They were killed by Jason Bourne.
Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows?
And Bourne? Where's he now?
I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me I need my pension but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this you can go to hell. Marshall too.  It had to be done.
So you had Conklin killed.  I mean if we're cutting the crap...
What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it couldn't find Bourne couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
I want to know what happened.
What are you after Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
Let's talk about Conklin.
He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files Ward.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
I want to know about Treadstone.
And what are we looking for?
With all due respect Pam I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
That's not gonna fly.
Never heard of it.
Treadstone.
Okay... 
Show me again...
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you right?
Who else knows about this?
Including Landy...  She had access to the archives.
Lots of people...
Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
Keep going...
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
Jesus...
Is it a slam dunk? No but...
It was staged?
There were two charges they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one the one that didn't go off was down here...  First of all this is nothing it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
And?
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
What do you have Danny?
I did my box work but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean I'm with you on this Conklin was a nut but a traitor? I just can't get there.
The sooner the better.
She say what time I should call?
Thanks.
Sir...
I'm sorry.
Is this really happening?
I have to go now.
No.  Because you don't want to know how it feels.
Because you're afraid!
I can't let you do that either.
I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now!
Look at me.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
You know I'm not.
You're a liar.
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
I don't want you to forgive me.
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
They loved you.  And I killed them.
You killed them.
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
I killed them.
Then what?
That's not what happened to your parents.
Yes...
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
What?
I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
No I do.
No. It's because you don't know how they died.
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
Okay.
Of all the people in the world you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here.
I speak English.
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
-- take the back -- get another car --
-- what? --
-- my coat -- but we should --
-- car keys?
How long? How long do I have -- 
I'm sorry.
You called it in?
I did.
She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while what do you talk about? I mean for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are...
I don't know! Why would I lie?
What's going on in Berlin?
I don't know who that is.
Pamela Landy?
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
Who sent you to Greece?
I don't know.
You're lying. If it's over why are they after me?
Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
Try again.
He's dead.
Conklin.
What do you want?
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
So why didn't you kill me then?
I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
You still should've moved.
Sorry. Old habits.
Front. Use your teeth.
Drop it.
Felt a little light.
I emptied it.
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
God I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
I only dream about people who are dead.
You do?
I know it's a dream.
It might have.
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
I did.
But you found another choice.
I wanted to kill him.
Tell me later.
I love you too.
There's no choice.
Jason please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
I warned them Marie. I told them to leave us alone.
There must be another way!
If he crosses the bridge it is.
What if it's not who you think it is?
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
Where are you going?
You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour.
-- hang on --
-- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready --
-- it's just him? --
-- not yet --
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
-- make the left -- toward the bridge --
-- where? -
Switch! You drive!
What?
You drive.
-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
-- where's left to go? --
Look we clear out we get to the shack we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
I don't want to move again... I like it here.
We can't wait to be sure.
...but you're not -- you're not sure...
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
Where --
No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there... 
That's crazy.
It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?
So...
He was at the campground yesterday.
But you're sure?
We pushed it. We got lazy.
But we were so careful.
The Telegraph office.
No... How?
One day it will be different. It just takes time.  We'll make new memories. You and me.
But it ends up the same.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
I should be better by now.
Sleep. Sleep now.
I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
It's just a nightmare.
I worry when you get like this.
I'm trying Marie Okay?
I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
-- it hasn't been two years --
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
No. There's nothing new.
I'll get the book.
Conklin up front.
Where were you Jason? In the car.
...it's not in the file... I swear... I know your file... your first job was Geneva!... I swear to God you never worked here!...
I was here!
No... Jason... please...
You never worked Berlin...
That's a lie!
Your first assignment was Geneva.
My first job.
No. You never worked Berlin.
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
What do you mean?
So when was I here?
He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris...
Abbott?
Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
Why are you here then?
Conklin! Stuff on Conklin! 
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
I killed him???
And you got to him before we could.
Last week? When?
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
A Russian?
Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national.
Say it.
I want to hear it from you.
What is this a game?
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?
They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is but they know!
Why is she trying to kill me?
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
You hear me? I believed you.
Who is Pamela Landy?
I did... Jason I swear I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...
Get on it.
Yes.
See that tram coming around the corner?
Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
You didn't answer my question.
Sounds like a threat.
Don't need it. I remember everything.
Do you think you can read? Are you well enough?
What's that?
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
Are you disappointed?
Why am I alive?
Careful...
Oh shit...
Ramstein Air Base Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.
Where am I?
Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.
Okay Jason your move.
There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication.
Who?
I want someone I know to take me in.
Okay how do you want to do it?
I want to come in.
What do you want?
Bourne?
It's me.
Hold on...  Yep. And Abbott just direct dialed Moscow from his room...
What? The tapes?
You're sure?
But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
This stays between you and I.  We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it.
What?
Alright... take it down.
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
-- the hotel -- how far? --
-- go -- take the van! --
-- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --
-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
Then get a number they need to know who they're dealing with.
There's only a Consulate they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
Who's going? Us?
Looks like he's been detained.
And the Germans can't match it?
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
I'm working on it.
We need to get in there.
-- shut up! -- just shut the --
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
-- who? -- who else is here? --
Is there. Is all there.
This is everything? Is there.
Now. Show now.
Here?
Show me.
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
Okay cut to the chase Pam. What are you selling?
For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects it's a bargain at ten times the price.
Still...
We're talking raw unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
It's a lot of money Pam.
That's where we came out.
I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?
I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes which means you are going to call me back in 30 and when I ask you where we stand I had better be impressed. My mobile number is...
Yes sir -- ma'am...
I want that area secured I want any evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??
If you ever want to make it to five you're gonna listen to me real close. Jason Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous. A week ago he assassinated two men in Berlin one of whom was a highly-experienced field officer... 
Me? Four years.
How long have you worked for the agency?
Pamela Landy again. Where do we stand?
Who's this?
Mr. Nevins?
Felt promising. It's a start.
So?
Let's give him half an hour.
Alright...
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
What do you think? Is he coming in?
It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
Is it fresh?
Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.
And why is that?
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
See that's a problem for me Nicky. Whatever he's doing we need to end it. This isn't the kind of mess you walk away from.
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
Some women like Dobermans --
These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans.
Did you?
You mean did I want a date?
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
If you say so.
So he fooled you.
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
Believed what?
Look what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
Are you an expert in amnesia?
Am I a doctor no but...
I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions?
You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
Good luck.
Before this? Before Bourne? No.
Amnesia?
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
What kind of problems?
And what about you anything?
Yes. In that order.
Are we hacking or asking?
We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed digital security cameras. Common feed.
Alright... I want you Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne track everything that's out there...
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
By who?
Here's what I've got.  Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered.
Yeah that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
Black coat possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there and then check them out but...
Are we locked up?
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
Anything?
What the hell is a "Treadstone?"
Yup...  The main word there the file heading translates as: Treadstone.
Do we know what this says?
I like the sound of that.
We're going to have to work on your touch.
My step-dad's. I'm strictly into stone. I was wondering when you'd walk by.
Those yours too?
No I mean... I'm a little... dusty...
Relax it's casual.
I'm not really dressed for a party.
I'm blind not deaf. Wanna come in?
How'd you know it was me?
Trust me this ain't one of those times.
Such a sad face... You know sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
You wouldn't say that if you could see me.
I don't think She's real big on hate.
Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
I mean...
I wouldn't know anything about that.
You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring whispering --
This ain't permanent. My friend Reed's working on a cure... I think.
"Sensual blind chick seeks three- ton rock-hard he-man for deep spiritual relationship."
You know you could'a run an ad in the personals.
Victor must've taken him.
Where is Reed?
No it's not. I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now Ben.
It's easy for you to be patient.
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
What did he do to the uniform?!
Oh he did.
He didn't.
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
You look like an eighties rock band.
Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
We need to give you a physical so we know what got zapped.
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
I can only stay for one drink Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
Is it safe?
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
Victor did.
I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?
I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
Way to not overthink it.  So when do we leave?
And you can? Power it up?
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
What do you want Vic?
Where do you think? With Sue.
What is this? Where's Reed?
Ben come in.
Come on. Let me buy you something to eat. Looks like you could use the company.
About me? How sweet.
I'm worried about you.
What are you doing here?
I already got it. Everything I want.
What did you wish for honey?
Deb it's me. It's still me.
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
Baby you're scaring me.
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
Ben?
Out front? You home baby? I got a surprise for you.
Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
I don't care about rocks I care about you.  You bring him back in one piece or you can forget being Best Man.
Soon as I'm back I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
Just get back soon or I start looking for a new groom.
I'll be watching over you.
Forget it egghead. I'm good as is.
Ben I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings...
Got it teach.
Time for your lesson Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...
Ben I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
We're working as hard as we can --
Oh you remember my name do you? You happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body?
Ben --
This isn't permanent Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.
It's about to be a broken face.
O-kay. We'll skip that question.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Ben I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Okay. I've uh got some questions from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you you know go to the bathroom... like normal...
If we're going to identify the source of the mutation we need to isolate your recombinant DNA so we can activate positional genomes.
You got a chisel round here?
Yeah nine years straight.
We had a tough year.
Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
Ben. Are you okay?
What the --!
I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
Are you alright?
Well maybe you should date him.
He's smart powerful successful --
I'm sorry did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
What? Come on. She's got a good thing with Victor --
Reed I'm not talking about Debbie.
Yeah you and Debbie and perfect --
You go through something like this makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
I should have done more run more tests --
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Solid.
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
How long was I out?
Ben. This is serious. Turn around.
I ain't done arranging your flowers egghead.
Should?
The shields on the station should protect us.
Victor's better at these things.
This is your dream Reed. You should be the one up there.
He's made a few changes.
Isn't that your speech?
This makes five.
I had it at four.
Five times.
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
I'm sure he's matured since then.
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
Youthful high spirits.
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
External SRBs orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
I know I know. I'm just worried about what he wants... Speaking of which...
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
Ben think about all the people we can help if this works --
He knew about NASA. What if he made the call to shut us down --
Ben the money's not important. We could save lives.
What about his first born?
Ben. This is business. Just work.
I can't take this.
You'd never know it.
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
This wasn't our first stop in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little...  Larger than life.
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food strip-mall science --
Hey I'm Mr. Sensitivity now.  Clear the way wide load coming through.
No more cracks about how I look.
Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
Go back to the drawing board.
Hey! That's a prototype!
Give me the god damn mirror!
They said that's not such a good idea the shock alone could --
Give me a mirror...
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world Ben. You had the best --
What's wrong with me?
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
Reed?... Sue?
Back on Earth. Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Where... where am I?
Don't you wander off boy.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Let's see: you got Victor stud of the year more coin than God? Or Reed the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm it's a toss-up.
Hey two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Yeah well his eyes say different.
'Course not. Strictly business.
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Keep talking there won't be a next time.
If you behave maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Actually the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut and your mind on those SMBs --
That's terrible news...
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
What?
I wish I could tell you. I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here. I'll notify the CDC and --
What do you mean "complete"?
At this rate the infection should be complete in two maybe three weeks --
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
And they're changing into...
Your tissue your organs your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning somehow --
No: You're ON FIRE!
Not this again --
You're on fire!
Last one down springs for room service.
I though we went over this.
Stay right. Left is trouble.
Me like-y.
Meet me at 4:01 top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
My shift ends at four but I couldn't --
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
I mean you feel a little feverish.
So are you!
You're hot!
I don't know if "we've" noticed but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are right outside that window --
And where do we think we're going?
Now.
But all these people...
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
Act. Here we go again. Reed what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some you know... like calling?
You need to control yourself and think before you --
Right whatever have fun.
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
They're not costumes.
He's right. These costumes are... missing something. I can't put my finger on it --
Oh well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
Is there something about flames? About flaming that you --
Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
Not only could you kill yourself but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
I can go hotter!
Back it down Johnny!
...and figure out how to reverse them. Let me show you to your rooms.
This place is deluxe. You got cable?
We should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes...
Oh it is.
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
You've been working out.
This is wrong in so many ways.
Ben are you there?
Oh you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
Cool. What'd it do to you guys?
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Now what is up with that?
Ben! Ben!
He's not responsive --
What about you?
Victor's right. Johnny get to the command center. Close the shields.
But Johnny... you can't fly.
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
What are you doing --
No I'm sorry for pushing you out.
I'm sorry sis for leaving you guys --
As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them.
Look around sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
Johnny slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
Is that what you call it? "Real"?
Yeah for the last time I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
Johnny? Did you see Ben?
Blockhead started it!
You two need a time-out.
You gave us names? What are you the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
You're gonna pay for that Pebbles.  What?!
Dude. That's my sister.
I'm driving.
Girl...?!
Uh we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl.
That's the temperature of the sun.
Sweet.
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter you're approaching supernova --
You're really cramping my style here.
Is that a trick question? C'mon I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
Grow up Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
I think that thing is Ben.
What is that thing?
Okay "mom."
Stop it.
Johnny.
Flame on flame off. Flame on flame off --
Please tell me you go silent too.
Apparently I can disappear.
Keep the hot side hot and the cool side cool!
The synthetics act as a second skin adapting to your individual needs to --
Top left like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow who knows... maybe Washington.
Front page?
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
Make sure you find Ben bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know when they asked Caesar "why England he said, because it's not mine."
Sir I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --
Later. First I've got some unfinished business. A deal that needs closing...
You know maybe you should get some rest --
And that's a good thing?
Actually uh people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Get me on the AM shows Larry King cover of the Journal...  I've got to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Sir I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
Reed's disaster. You know I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number considering the fallout from --
How's the IPO?
Recording sir. We see you perfectly.
Leonard how's the feed?
History Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Then what is it?
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
Showtime.
They're ready for you sir.
Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
And if he's not...?
If Reed's right then this little trip will double our stock offering.
A gasket? Reed we're at a party.
I found a broken gasket from space --
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Sue I need some of that anger rage frustration --
You need a doctor.
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
Reed stop you need to rest your --
I can... make it work.
That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
Why didn't you say something?
When I walked out I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
I did. I did Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
I gave him twenty.
You know I bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late?
Of course I was. I'd read all your papers on bioethics. Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you.
You were?
Remember our first date here...? God I was so nervous.
Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up.
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
I'm not the only one in there. I got you Vic Ben Johnny all rattling around in there.
Every variable but yourself. You don't eat sleep. You can't live in your head like --
Which is why I'm working twenty hours a day checking every variable --
Better than your life. Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing. We are.
He was going to take away all my data equipment --
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
No way to know. Without more tests experiments.
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
With the right energy we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
Of course. Of course.
But we're the focus right Reed? Reed...?
Curing countless diseases not just ours.
And reverse the mutations --
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm we can reverse the polarity --
The plants from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
What are you doing?
No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
There were a lot of variables to consider --
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
I think it was a little more complicated than --
Reed. I was ready for the next step you weren't ergo I walked.
No I distinctly remember: you walked out my door. Ergo...
Are you kidding?
I mean you broke up with me right?
What in the world would give me that idea?
I'm sorry I'm sorry I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
I'm saying if you had a little more self control you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when --
Excuse me?
You should be able to bend light around other objects even people if you could control your emotional state better --
What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
If it happened to him then it could...
That's what we're here to find out.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
What...?  Oh.
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.
We need to get past them.
What?
Let's not jump to conclusions we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap.
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
Sue... look at your hands.
What? What do you mean you --
Uh Sue...? I can't.
You are such a dork Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics.
For science.
Passion.
Which was?
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
You're happy for me and Victor.
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
That's good. That's uh... good.
Yes thanks.
Feeling better?
Great minds think alike.
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules. I've been working on a formula for this.
Well he's welcome to ride shotgun but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny...
As far as crew I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
It's been changed.
I uh think I remember the number.
Right. That's exactly what I meant.
Well uh based on our history... you can handle the biogenetics and I'll focus on the molecular physics. Or uhm maybe I should take the biotech you work the microscopes since you have some background in electropho--
I was talking about us. Working together.
Those solar winds are flaring but I factored them into my coordinates and --
Never better.
You're you've I mean how have you bee--
Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.
But I'm not done with the machine --
What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents Reed. This all belongs to me.
What are you doing here?
I don't want to understand it. This isn't one of your science projects. I just want to fix it. Fast!
Victor if we could understand what happened to us --
Abort? Reed I put my company my name billions of dollars on the line and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
I ruined? With all due respect I told you to abort --
Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --
Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
Ben did this?
Ben did this.
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
It's too late for him and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
Not until Ben is back inside!
Reed we're running out of time.
Come on Ben come on...
So reel him in. But we came here to do a job. So let's do it. Quickly.
Ben's still out there --
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
We've got minutes until it hits not hours... Victor that storm's deadly -- the radiation's lethal. We need to abort.
Sure.
Got it. So take a walk Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Hilarious.
Funny how things turn out isn't it?
The number's seventy-five. And it's applications and patents.
You back this mission and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
Not at all.
This isn't going to be a problem is it?
You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
But dreams don't pay the bills do they?  Same old Reed the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars with the world on your back.
Victor we can't do anything until the research is ready.
Oh I think you already have.
Please don't make this personal --
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
If these molecules aren't stable they could make us worse maybe even kill us.
Same old Reed. All analysis no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested analyzed before --
Susan. What are you doing?
Victor wait slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me but I just don't --
It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...
You said it was urgent.
Please no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
I told you I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
Victor your scar --
Just find him.
Victor I'm sorry I --
Victor are you feeling alright?
What's going on?
You can't leave them out there.
Raising the shields.
What are you doing?
Sue I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Uh Victor I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Right of course the company... But you see I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
It's been a good two years Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
Well when you're looking at your future it never hurts to find closure about the past.
I understand the business reasons.
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research Susan Storm.
It's just business.
Skeptical...?
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Reed's gonna fix me up --
I'm just saying I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away and know it's never coming back.
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
'Scuse me.
They'll get in! We'll all die!
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
They can't get in here!  You said it yourself they'll get in!
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
Stop!
I figure it's karma. You wronged me and you wronged your wife and you wronged your children so this is karma biting you on the ass or in your case...  ...on the eye.
Spare me.
It serves you right. You cheatin' jerk.
I don't know I just got here. Did you find your girl?
Where is everyone?
Sorry didn't mean to scare you.
We're going to get my little girl.
Where are you two going?
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
We'll meet in three hours?
Um yeah thirty miles east.
You know where it is?
Oh come on! Can't you be happy for one split second? They're gone!
They'll be back.
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
He's right let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up grab the weapons.
We should go! We should go right now!
Don't be stupid drop the gun!
I will not die because of him!
I'm telling you I don't see a thing --
Careful.
Right.
We can't risk letting them in.
You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
With what just happened upstairs --
I don't think you should...
I got shells too box and a half tops.
I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs I think we got another rifle maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
But it's got teeth.
Well it don't look pretty.
Her fella.
My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
Nah I got the gun.
IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
Yeah.
IS IT CLEAR?!
We're lucky to be alive.
We shot a skunk.
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
Stop it.
Anyone.
Who the hell would you call?
I have a CB in my truck we could get some help out here.
Gonna stay for a couple?
One keg of Beast for the basement then truck's dry.
You gotta be with me on this.
Well your last words can be "I told you so."
We'll be food dickheads!
If we move in a group we are one target. If we scatter they CAN'T get us all.
You got something better?
OPEN THE DOOR!
Wha?
"OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean?
Oh!
Come on come on.
Okay now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
Upstairs.
Where's that?
I think I know where a CB is.
C'mon guys--
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
Buddy I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.
You seem mighty collected about this.
Just move!
I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
Shit!
We just smeared a skunk.
In the corner behind the curtain.
Where's the tunnel?
Follow me.
You all sure about this?
This is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front we're dead. We go out the back we're dead but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now who else is in? Seven can go.
What!? I'm not going down there again!
HEY! No I'm not trusting him either that's why you and I will both be going with him.
What's it for?
It's in the basement about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
What tunnel? Where?
There's a tunnel.
Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out --
Easy.
Jesus Christ I'm gonna have a stroke.
Hey!
They're right here.
Well justice is funny.
No no no it was... it was wild out there no time to think we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
So your husband ditched you?
And the head?
And that's how I ended up here.
Unfortunately the worst of 'em are still outside.
And the rest of 'em?
That's the oldest of the bunch looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one Junior in the cooler there. As we've seen what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
Well why don't you keep your observations to yourself?
Just an observation.
That's an unwise thing to say you know that?
Look.
What?
Ohhh.
The door... on three.
I'd love to be macho but this is a pants wetter from all angles.
Of course not. I fight monsters all the time.
No. You?
Scared?
Get in line!
Fuck you too.
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
My truck.
What now Geronimo?
He's dead.
Come on!
Who's with me?
We're better off.
Believe me I'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch. But it's not in the cards partner.
Well then I guess we should just give up.
Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten you stay in here you get eaten anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here Spuds Makenzie?
Oh yeah?
I'm telling ya you got the cloth too deep you're asking for it.
Go douche.
You weren't helpin'.
Any more ideas Animal Planet?
Fuck no.
Why don't you go check it out?
So what now? Did those things leave?
We lived near power lines.
Your parents of relation?
Yep.
Your brother huh?
Look yeah he's an ass but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
Why do you take shit from him?
Just cover me. It was built to move.
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
But not flush against the tunnel?
Yeah the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
Nothing this was my last delivery.
What's in the back?
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
Uh uh I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
All right!  Tell us about the truck!
What?
We gotta be close.
Anybody else?
We gotta try.
We're going to get help.
Anyone else?
I'm in.
Uh huh now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face I wanna do some appraising.
What? Really?
You don't understand sweety Daddy doesn't pay Daddy sees the show for free. But you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
How much you got to see the show?
How much I got what?
How much you got?
Sure.
You wanna see baby?
The girl's got rhythm.
Um-hmmm.
I can't feel a thing Hon.
Doesn't your foot hurt?
Okay then.
It's much safer in there sweety.
But --
Wait before you do that help me to the kitchen I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
Why not then?
No no it calms you makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer but in a fraction of the time.
Will I go crazy or something?
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
Really?
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
Oh no.
Magic potion.  You should try a little.
What is this?
Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
Oh.
Push and twist it's child proof.
Well...
How are you holding up?
I don't trust you. No way! I pick who goes! And I'm holding you responsible.
Let me make this clear; if we stay we die!
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
Keys.
Seven.
Nine?
Seven.
Max?
Holds four.
How many?
Covered.
Open?
Two.
Four door?
Fully.
Is it gassed up?
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away deliveries whatever.
What's it for!?
Nothing.
What's going on between you two?
Huh?
What do you mean what?
What?
What?
You're wasting your time there's no one out there.
Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point.
No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all unarmed.
In the kitchen under the sink.
Good.
The boards are solid oak planks and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this least nothing the size of the beasts.
Will these boards hold?
He shot you the other time.
Huh?
He only shot you once.
So your dead hubby shot me twice three of my customers have been eaten and there are angry creatures outside?
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast volatile predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
Jesus Christ on the cross... Someone make sense.
What?
He's dead.
Well where's the sonuvabitch!?
My husband...
What are you gonna do? Throw your teeth at 'em? Sit down Cocoon.
I'll go with ya.
They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
I wouldn't do that son.
I think that's for bears and sharks chunky chew.
Sit still look less like a meal.
Oh? And what's that?
You young'uns worry about weapons I'm thinkin' bout strategy.
Whoa!
This one will just stun ya but this one will put ya to sleep.
Get outta here.
What's that!? Wha'cha say? Huh?
Clear!
Blow the goddamn hatch!
What the hell's going on here!?
Clever fuckers.
No bullshit.
Bullshit.
Hey when this plan completely goes to shit what are ya gonna do?
Look the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group. Those that can shoot protect the rest to his ride.
You smell like ass!
They were all over the place.
F-f-fuck you.
Welcome back.
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant by the IGA on First. You all know where that is?
Where the hell are we going to go then Billy Jack!?
Get something on that.
Yeah maybe.
HELLLLLLLLP!!
COME ON!
MOVE YOUR ASS!
SHIT.
REPEAT. WE NEED HELP. SOS. CALLING ALL CARS! WE NEED HELP AT THE UNITED NATIONS TAV--!
Hurry!
If he doesn't shut up...
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
I'm fine! I'm fine!
Shit!
You keep that key handy.
Move it!
No shit.
Move slow and move quiet.
What?!
Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?
Well we are one miracle short tonight. So just guard the stairs?
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral.
What?
NO but I will lock you in.
Gimme the keys.
Fine Chief.
Duh hickey.
'Eh Chief?
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
Got 'cha!
HELLLPPP!
OH JESUS!
Don't worry you'll be like my little papoose.
Am I too heavy for you?
Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
Amazing you made it this far.
I'm in a wheelchair the truck sounds pretty good.
BONSAI!
HELP MEEE!
I'm sure.
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
You don't want the rag to touch the booze that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.
Let's move.
Ok. Let's see what happens.
Yeah I'll go.
Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
Okay well... anybody else have an idea?
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So who's going into the basement with me?
Hey!
As long as it's dark they're around. They hide wait for you to drop your guard and then attack.
Well maybe they migrate?
They'll tear this place down within the hour.
Let's wait it out.
YOU'LL HIT US!
DON'T!
She's not very nice is she?
Let's go.
Nothing just lookin'.
What's wrong?
Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
GO-GO-GO!!
Get to your cars!
Go!!!
Not without you!!!
Go! Go!
Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there right?
If there is only one way out for us there is only one way in for them.
Wait God-dammit!
Let's go!
Whoa!
Hold it!
That's fine.
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
So we've got guns kitchen knives pipes fire and sticks.
Okay well that's something.
Father. The biggest the strongest...
And the last one is the...
If you are face to face with her dive left.
I think --
Did we make it?
I'd love to.
We should stick together out there.
Deal.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
I'll do anything to help.
She's still alive I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
Oh...
Her name is Charlie.
Right.
We all have to be strong right?
I admire your strength.
I'm fine I really am.
You know you don't have to do this.
All right.
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
Let's lock off this room.
Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never ever never let you go.
Stop her!
Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!
That's one piece of four problems.
Oh my God... What is that?
I just hit it like you said.
What have you done now broke the darn thing?
I said I'm not lying.
You know that no one likes a liar right?
I'm not lying.
What did we say about lying?
Well...
Are you lying to me?
Um well...
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
Um my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present sir.
Hey little bear aren't you going to join the others?
Oh right --
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
Remind me why I keep doing this.
Didn't even buy me a drink.
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
I dunno maybe five seconds -- ow!
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
I'm lucky that way.
You were burned by some organic acid.
No listen this: Sammael the desolate one lord of the shadows son of Nergal --
Nah -- he's taken care of.
Red I found something --
Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed.  Whatcha havin'? Six library guards raw? Plus belts and boots? Man you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --
Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil ancient and hungry.
Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water silver shavings white oak: the works.
We don't take hints.
Liz left us Red. Take the hint.
How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck
Nothing psychic about it. You're easy.
Don't get psychic with me.
You mean outside... with her.
I break it they see us Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
Story of my life.
Look at them ugly suckers Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
It doesn't say --
Skip to the end willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
harbinger of pestilence seed of destruction --
-- Hound of resurrection?
See? I don't like that --
hound of resurrection --
Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
That's all for you Sammy.
From where??!!
Cordon off the area. Something came through.
Air and sea backup. What's closest?
If he's here this is worse than I thought.
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen one of the Reich's top Scientists. Head of the Thule Occult Society.
The freak in the gas mask --
Oh I'll bet you have.
I have seen ghosts Whitman.
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
What a load of crap. Hell a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines the boundaries between our world and the other --
You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
Three days too late for that one "professor."
I abhor violence.  Sergeant Whitman I hope you don't think me mad --
Here. You'll need one of these.
Amongst other things yes -- but that's hardly the point.
You are a Catholic??
In private if you don't mind...
What is it?
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside now.
This is an important mission Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
I think that is its hand.
It's got a big stone -- in its hand --
No. It was red. Bright red.
What the hell was that? An ape?
That makes him more than a hundred --
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916 at a dinner in his honor he was poisoned shot stabbed clubbed drowned and castrated.
C'mon -- Rasputin??
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
Grigory -- That's Russian right?  Thought they were on our side...
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
Do you believe in hell?
No. It's not.
It's almost over!!
I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
These freaks Trevor they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
He's just going through a phase --
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five bright red and is government funded.
Tom -- he's our guest not a prisoner.
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
I thought you liked being on TV.
Every time the media get a look at him they come to me. I'm running out of lies Trevor.
Oh as opposed to -- ?
It's her choice --  She's human --
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
Is it bad?
Don't look! Turn around.
Oh stop that --  Damn! Be careful there --
Well I won't be around forever you know?
Me?? C'mon --
I worry about you.
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
Son. About Rasputin --
A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy.
Reliquary --
Smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. The statue however was hollow --
Who wards off demons.
A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
Oh please. I'm not "pure of heart."
And as a father I worry about him.  In medieval stories Agent Myers there's often a young knight inexperienced but pure of heart...
You're doing fine.
I'm in way over my head I know that much.
Did he now?
1945 you mean. Hitler died in '45.
1958 the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
"In the absence of light darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
"In absentia luci tenebrae vinciunt..."
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
On the desk yes. In Latin.
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
Where am I -- exactly Sir?
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
How does he know so much about me?
The day Abraham Lincoln died. Hence "Abe" Sapien.
Icthyo Sapiens April 14 1865.
They took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
C'mon champ. You look a little woozy there.
Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes and reproductions.
At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
C'mon Champ! Happy Halloween!!! You're taking me for a walk!
We're on the move.
Hey hey hey. They're playing our song.
Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.
"Myers" huh? You have a first name??
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
Well you did break out --
Manning says I'm too soft on you --  The candy. Give him the candy.
I don't want him.
Nah. I'll be around Red just back in the field.
Got tired of me?
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
Who's the squirt?
Not so fast. He barely knows him --
Sir may I go first??
His what??!!
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
Uh-oh -- John.  Staring at what?
Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.
Oh Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --
Who?!
He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny his keeper his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised --
Okay. You saw the fish man right?
Grounded? Who's grounded?
They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
I can live with that.
You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
Anung-un-Rama...
Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads."  And crossroads I have become.  Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key.
Noooo! Noooo!!!
She's dead.
Don't tell me it's Zeppo.
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling your true name.
That voice --
My job.
Thank you.
You never ever light a cigar that way.
Yup.
You call that thing a cigar??
You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.
I'm in charge. We go back!
No. Don't --
-- should go back. Now!
Don't move. We --
We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
I won't take 'em. They never work.
Each of us gets a belt.
Those things never work. Never.
We've installed a very handy timer. Set it walk away. Cable pulls the safety pins K-boom! Easy to clean easy to use...
When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
"One falls two shall arise." So: you pop one two come out. You kill two you get four. You kill four you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
I wish I could be more gracious but --
In the end after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
What are you trying to say?
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
No it doesn't make it right but I stopped that creature didn't I?
Ah I see. That makes it all alright then.
I knew those men better than you did --
But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.
How big can it be?
Alone?
Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you Myers. She's a tough one.
Are you sure about this?
Good night.
Well good n-
Not from you.
Anything else you --
Not hungry.
Hey your chili's getting cold --
Start in you got nachos coming.
Nah sounds too "needy."
"Need" is a good solid word.
Myers you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for "need" --
Shh! Just a second.
Where do you --
Hostage negotiations.
What was that??
What landed you this job pushing "pamcakes"? Punctuality? What was your area of expertise?
I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
Hey. You: think twice --
Professor that girl you were talking about --
Mmmh -- "Pamcakes." We're going out --
Well let's see -- there was that moment when I had a train on top of my head --
Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?
That's right Stud hold me down.
You want me to hold him down?
Could've fooled me. Go away.
No. I never was.
What are you a Boy Scout?
C'mon time to go home. Tape you up.
What took you so long?
Goodbye.
Yes?
Myers?
No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
No no no it's fine: I do my job I take a break.
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up.
My arm is fine. Where are you??
Myers??? How's your arm?
No one ever helps me. It's my job.
Helping you -- I just --
Oh-n-no -- I --
Whatcha looking at John??
Father's back?  Still angry?
Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.
Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.
You're kidding --
...Polo.
Marco...
Okay someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
Good.
I like that...
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
Red I --
But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
I've changed my mind. I'll come to Moscow. If you -- are still going --
Hi.
Oh okay then. Maybe later then.
It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --
No. Myers is taking me.
You're going alone?
For a cup of coffee but go ahead read.
Out? Out out?
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out but --
Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
Goodnight.
Goodnight then.
No. Not this time H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.
We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back Liz. Come back. I --
Just a scratch.  I wanted to see you.
You better have that looked at.
What?
Hit me.
You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red white whatever -- Guys are all the same.
That you feel that way about me.
What -- ?
But it's not true is it?
Coffee's warming me up.
It's freezing isn't it?
Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too but now every time I see him I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now I feel he's here --
What about you?
I know.
He -- loves you.
My uncle used to say... we like people for their qualities but love them for their defects.
A brute.
Strong.
Cocky.
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
He's just pushy.
I admire him. He's a force of nature.
Miss Sherman he's asking you back but it's entirely your choice.
Doesn't sounds like him.
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks.
It's still impressive by my standards: My name's John.
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
Liz -- can I call you Liz? It's a beautiful name --
Two steps back please.
Pardon?
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
Yes I --
-- Late. Five minutes late.
Hello I'm --
RUN!
What --
I'm sorry John but you have to run again.
Oh Jesus...
She's not alive but she didn't die.
She's still alive?
She grew up.
She died?
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
Who wanted her little girl back?
Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.
I am going back.  I see myself there.
Agatha you're never going back there.
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank I won't remember any of this.
You want to spend the rest of your life in the temple?
The other two will die without me.
Why?
I have to go back.
Someplace safe.
Where are we going?
But you still have a choice.  The others never had a chance to see their future.  You did.
I can't leave.  You said so yourself there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
Please I want to go back...
You were right.  I'm not being set up.
Anderton --
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
What is it?
Oh God...
I have to find out what happened to my life.  Agatha.  I'm not going to kill the man.  I don't even know him.
Please --
I can't.  I have to know.
Anderton leave.
He's here.
Wait.
Agatha...
He won't.
He'll turn around.
No.  Follow him.
Do it.  Right here.  On the ground.
Forget that guy --
Drop some money.
What?
Can you see the balloon man?
Agatha --
Agatha...
Take it.
Who?
They're inside.
What?
Is it now?
What?
Is it now?
I'm sorry but I need your help. You contain information.  I need to know how to get it.  Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?  Can you tell me if --
Can you see?
Wally!
How did I not see this?  Agatha who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?
John?  What is it?
I know... I do too...
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
Anne Lively...
About who?
Because I found out about her...
Think John.  Why would they set you up?
Somewhere.
Found?  Where?
Just some guy... they found.
Then who was he?
-- but he didn't.
-- go blind.  I know.
I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then or you'll --
Organic microbots that reconstruct the nerves and blood vessels. It'll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs.  But whatever you do don't scratch.
The nano... what?
I know you're in a hurry so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
I can't even stand up --
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
Here --
How do I find the --
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
So uh if you were a plastic surgeon before...
And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others but let's change the subject shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?
You set your patients on fire!
They were performance pieces.
You made those tapes...
Yes you did.
I put you away --
Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
From where?  D.C.?
Oh yes.
We know each other?
You don't remember me do you?
Tell you what since you and I go way back I'll give you my Old Pal discount.  How's that sound?
It's all I could safely move.
That's not much.
Whatever you say John.
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
Why?
I know that but I wanna keep the old ones.
And replace them with new ones.
Yeah --
Anesthesia.  Try to relax John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
Right.  I know --
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
That's comforting.
Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
It's actually kind of a rush.  They say you get visions; that your life flashes before your eyes.  That all your dreams come true.
Lara --
You're part of my flock now John. Welcome.
So she cleaned up.  Where is she now?
Looks like she was a neuroin addict like John Doe here but I show an address history that includes the Beaton Clinic.
Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
Hey you wanna know where the word came from "glitch?"
No... we have the two previsions from the twins right here but...  ... I can't pull up any data from the female.  Probably just a glitch.
Try again.
Huh we don't seem to have her data.
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
Not to mention "Saved by the bell".
... Graveyard shift.
Hence the expression...
I work graveyard swing and day all by my lonesome.
You the only sentry?
For that we have to go for a ride.
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
That's an old one.  One of our first.
This about the Justice Department?  They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  Told me to wear a tie.  You like this one?
Victim's a white female.
Drowning.
Kill type?
No you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
I don't ever see any of you precops down here I'm not in trouble am I?
Yes sir.  I'm Gideon.  The music relaxes the prisoners.
You the sentry?
Then go ahead pull the trigger.
No doubt.
No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.
Beauty?  The precogs don't even always agree with each other!
People want to believe in the system.  That's the beauty of it...
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
John --
Everybody runs.
You can't run --
I'm not getting halo'd.
John.  Please.  Listen to me --
John.  Just tell me who's Leo Crow?
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar I need you to talk to Wally see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
We're years from that.  John I'm asking you: please come in we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
Can you fake the cerebral output?
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
All right John just take a breath let's think about this...
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
And who the hell is that?
Somebody named Leo Crow.
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
Justice already knows.  Talk to me John.  Tell me what's happening?
Just so you know I've overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --
No?  How's an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?
We won't let them.
You understand John that the minute Precrime goes national they're going to take it away from us.
I'm fine Lamar.
What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
In the middle of the night?
I go running down there.
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
I'm fine.
She's worried about you.  And quite frankly so am I.
What?
Lara called me.
He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us John.
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there.  And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
And you say the third prevision was what a little fuzzy or something?
Tuck in your shirt.
I understand.  What's the other thing?
You can let him look around answer his questions but watch him.  If there's any problems make sure we know about it first.
Yes sir.
I need you to do two things for me. One watch Danny Witwer.
I understand.  Sir.
You understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what we've been doing down here has been some noble-minded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.
Don't apologize John.
Lamar I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
Hang on Lamar --
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
Uh-huh...
Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.
The nation votes this week...
Don't worry Lamar.
Tell me not to worry John.
You don't have to chase me Fletcher.
You don't have to do this Chief.
Everybody runs.
Don't run Chief.  You know we'll catch you.  You trained us.
I show a cop on horseback.
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
The brick has been repointed the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
What he's doing now we call "scrubbing the image" looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
Get him some coffee and tell him to wait outside.
Uh sir...
All I need some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went check all relations --
I wrote it down in your calendar then left a message at your house --
You're kidding that's today?
Chief the investigator from the Fed is here.
Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
Seventeen minutes.
Take your time.
Sure Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
Uh yeah you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
Still scrubbing... looks like there's a third party somebody wearing shades just out the window...
Any ID on the shooter yet?
Confirm with trig and image.
That was easy.
I show time of occurrence Friday at fifteen-zero-six hours.
Check NCIC maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And Jad I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
The victim's name is Leo Crow.
Amazing there's someone within two hundred miles actually dumb enough to still do that.
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
Red Ball?
We're in motion on something.
Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
Go back to work.  All of you.
Sir?
Uh-huh.  Jad?
Come on Chief you think about it the way we work -- changing destiny and all -- we're more like clergy than cops.
You guys are nodding your heads like you actually know what the hell he's talking about.
Did Marks close the front door?!
What?
Did he close the front door?
Go ahead.
Now look at him...
Yeah?  So?
Look at the kid.  In this one he's on the left of the man in the suit.
Georgetown.
The mall?
No maglev system.
Somewhere near the capital?
From solar position Trig & Image confirms it at approximately eight oh-four a.m.
Send a DCPD blue & white out there set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
Run the subscription list...
We can't grab it...
Case #1108 previsualized by the Precogs and recorded on holoshpere by Precrime's q-stacks.  My fellow witnesses for case #1108 are Dr. Katherine James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.
We need confirmation on the time frame.  Location still uncertain. Remote witnesses are hooked in...
Red Ball -- double homicide: one male one female.  Killer's male white 40's.
Okay Jad what's coming?
Possession alone will cost you six months not to mention your badge.
You gonna tell on me?
It seems I've found a flaw John  You.
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
You set me up...
I agree.  The system is perfect. If there's a flaw it's human.  It always is.  Thank you for the tour Wally.
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
Flaws.
Why don't you cut the cute act Danny and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
I don't know.  He was shot and killed when I was fourteen on the steps of his church in Bethesda.
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.
The oracle isn't where the power is anyway.  The power's always been with the priests.  Even if they had to invent the oracle.
Just a nickname.
But you call this room the "temple".
The precogs are pattern recognition filters nothing more.
I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
If it's a question of authority.
Maybe you didn't hear me.
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
Really?  You've never been inside?
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
To them.
To Hineman?
Speaking of interfacing I'd love to say hello.
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs designed the system and pioneered the interface.
Then why can't they see rapes or assaults... or suicides?
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do only what you will do.
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
But it didn't fall.  You caught it.
Yes.
You're certain?
Because it was going to fall.
Why did you catch that?
Yes it is.
But it's not the future if you stop it.  Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
You mind if I tag along?
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
As I recall they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
Your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office...
I'm sorry Danny but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
Just go to the beginning!
There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
Are these all of her previsions?
Oh... Hi John.
I like you Wally so I'm not gonna kick you or hit you with anything but only if you promise to help me...
Do I know you?  Who are you?
Wally listen to me...
She said...
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
She spoke to me.
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
She was looking right at me.
She grabbed you?  Impossible.  The Precogs aren't even aware of us. In the milk all they see is the future.
Nothing... she grabbed me and then there was an image on the screen...
Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
It helps if you don't think of them as human.
They're not in any pain.  We keep their heads pretty well stocked with dopamine and endorphins. Plus we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels -- don't want 'em to drift off to sleep but they can't be kept too awake either.
Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
I can't touch you!  And John you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
Uh I'll try...
Rufus play it back...
I guess that's all of it.
What happened?  Where's the rest?
Tell me how.
Stop --
Then take her to Radio Shack.
They don't belong to anybody.
I tell you what.  I do this I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
So now I need you to hack into her.
So?
C'mon Rufus you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
She's got information inside of her.  I need you to get it out.
I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do!  And I swear I didn't do any of the stuff I did!
Rufus for Christ's sake get up.
Are you reading my mind right now?
That's right.
She's a precog?
Rufus.  She's a precog.
I'm impressed Anderton.  You're on the lam but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
Well hello there honey-pie.
I need help with her.
Well hey you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you Chief I make housecalls...
I need your help.
Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus what's up with your eye?
Hold your breath Dad...
Sean wait...
I'm your son.  I'm you.
Who are you?
Good-bye Dad...
I wanted to.
I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
I was looking for you...
The more you want to believe something the easier it is to be fooled.
I forgive you...
Once I even told him I loved him.
I forgive you.
I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
Sean --
The funny thing is I started to believe he really was my Dad.
Oh Sean --
No.  He got tired of pretending.
You're alive?
I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
What the hell.
Wanna hear something funny?
It's a little late for that.
You gotta have faith Dad.
Sean -- you're not real.
All right I'll try...
Come on!
Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way on my best day I could ever beat twelve seconds!
Okay... now let me time you.
I love you too!  I love you daddy.  Love ya dad.
Four.  Wow.  What a big boy.  I love you Sean.
What a big boy.  How old are you?
I won!
That's great.
I scored a goal!
Good-bye Crow.
You're not gonna kill me...
Let go of the gun.
Tell me!
Kill me!
Who made you do this?
If I tell you my family gets nothing.
Tell me who was it set this up?
Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me Goddammit before I lose my nerve!
What about the picture --
What the fuck is going on?
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is the next day I was out so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look man you gotta go through with this.
I'm asking you again who made you do this?
Look believe me I know it's hard but you gotta do it --
Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
Look I've put my family through enough misery.  You gotta kill me! This way I can leave 'em something.
Who said I would?
You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.
If you don't kill me my family gets nothing!
The precogs were wrong.
But you have to.  They said you would.
No.
You're not gonna kill me?
NO!
It floated back up.  I had to take him out and --
I put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay.
Where've you got him?  Is he all right?  Tell me you fuck -- WHERE IS HE?!
He's alive?
... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song made him laugh bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
His name was Sean.  Six years ago. Francis pool.
Some -- somebody's father?
Do you know who I am?
Did I?  I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --
Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
The female.
Which one is that?
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
How do I even know which one has it?
Sometimes in order to see the light you have to risk the dark.
I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
You're insane or you think I am.
Actually I think you'll have to run out but yes that's what you have to do.
-- and then walk out.
If... you have one.
That's all huh?  Just walk right into Precrime go into the Temple somehow tap into the Precogs and then download this Minority Report...
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
Where?
The safest place of all.
What safe place is that?
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time.  I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
You said they're destroyed.
You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
Why should I trust you?
Hold that thought.
I'm not gonna kill anybody.
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
You want to bring it down.
Do you?  Really?
I believe in that system...
The system would collapse.
Insignificant to you maybe but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
Yes of course he knew but at the time he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime.  Well in my experience parents often see their children as they want them to be not as they are.
Does Burgess know about this? About the Minority Report?
I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might just might have an alternate future.
You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people?
Obviously for Precrime to function there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable but it's still doubt.
Why?
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
Most of the time all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while one of them will see things differently than the other two.
What?
I can't help you.  No one can.  The Precogs are never wrong.
So you won't help me?
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
Not if I stay away from him.
And yet a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now isn't it?
You say some of the children died?
Back then he was still a DA and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way you know paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
And how did Lamar become involved?
It began as play.  A guessing game like you play with any toddler except these children always guessed right.  And then the nightmares started. They were all different but all the same.  They were all about murder.  And the murders were all happening.
You think the three in the tank come from a test tube?  They're merely the ones who survived.
You're talking about the precogs...
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
Heal who?
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them not turn them into... something else.
You don't seem all that proud.
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention then yes I invented precrime.
What's so funny?
And how would I know that?
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
I'm... not... a... killer.
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
The vine -- the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall...
The what?
Yes I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
I'm a little dizzy...
Something wrong?
Lara I don't know why this is happening.  I just know they're setting me up.  I can't trust anybody.  I don't know who to talk to or where to go...  Lara?  Are you there?
Then how did he --
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
Oh God what did you do?
He's dead Lara.
John?
Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
Lamar --
But I also know why he married you: you're as stubborn as he is.
No.  I don't think you do.  The other day when he came to the cottage he talked about a lot of things but Danny Witwer the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
I understand.
No.  That's what everyone thinks.  John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
Sean --
Lamar do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
He also said Crow was a fake.
We know why John was tagged.
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
I don't know who that is.
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
Who?
I was but this whole incident with John made me realize the fragility of what we've built here.  This is John's legacy as much as mine and I want to protect that.
I thought you were retiring?
It's insanity around here.
You look great.
I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
No it isn't Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
This is all my fault.
Thank you.  This is Burgess.
You have an emergency call on your private line.
I padded your expense account for the last six months.
How did you get this?
My God...
Congratulations sir.
I'll be right there.
Sir the press conference is starting.
Not.  Now.
He just wanted a few minutes before --
Tell him not now.
The guy from USA Today is here.
Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things Danny?  Because right now the Precogs can't see.
What?
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
Of course it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place someone fairly high up --
Yes.
So there is a way to fool the system?
We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
Precog Deja Vu...
Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
By fooling the system.  All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place then a few minutes later commit the crime in exactly the same way.
How?
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
Danny tell me what you're thinking.
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is why would someone want this erased from the data file?
I know.  He came to me told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
According to the Sentry Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
This murder is happening at two different times.
I don't understand --
Now the second image.  Watch the water.  The wind's changed.  The ripples are going the other way.
Not quite.
It's the same prevision.
Yes.  This is from the twins Arthur and Dashiel.  Agatha's stream was missing.  Now this one is from the cyberparlor.  Anderton downloaded it directly from Agatha. Watch...
He told me about this.  You got this from Containment?
Wait just a second...
Good God.  What was that?
Where are you?
I don't wanna say over the phone but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
What?
Lamar I found something.
I don't want John Anderton hurt.
Shall we call the Attorney General? I'm sure he'd be happy to clarify the issue for you.
He's my subordinate!
Oh it's all my damn business now Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
None of your damn business.
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
The man lost a child for Christ's sake...
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping yet you did nothing about it.
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year and I'm inclined to agree.
He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
Get the hell outta here.  You sick bastard.
No I wanna kill my boss!
Uh yeah being concert master of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
Good.  What I can do is set you up down in the --
Right here.
Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
I wanna kill my boss.
Near Death's real popular right now which includes everything from getting hit by a car to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush you come out the other side without a heart attack.
None.  This was arranged.
How many?
I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy Gordon?
Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
What kind of cop were you before this?
They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
If you were a child killer you took these pictures would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
I don't know why?
There a maid in this hotel?
No.  He can't...
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
He's trying to prove his innocence.
She's in the room with him when he kills Crow.  She's already a part of his future.
We can stop him.
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
Two?
There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
Because he thinks he's innocent.
No offense sir but why wouldn't he just run?
Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket.  There's fewer consumers down there which means fewer scanners to target him.
They're everywhere.
There's thousands of units like this one.
Here's where we're at.  Three men in a room.  The victims here. Anderton here and this unidentified male out the window. The exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing but I can't make out the location. Government architecture is modern/conformist which means --
Yes I know.
Sir the team's gonna be light without those men.
What?!
Actually Gordon you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
Somehow I don't think that was Walt Whitman.
Because of the nature of murder.  "There's nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another".
I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
People have gotten the message.  Gum?
Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
That's the Red Ball Alarm.
Can't they shut that off?
Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes we go national there's gonna be nowhere to run.
So if you wanna kill someone you take him to Miami.
Nice to meet you.  Gum?
This is Evanna the team pilot.
You "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years not one damn murder...
John Anderton was my friend!
Cause all of a sudden you got no one you can fucking brown nose anymore.
Why don't I feel like celebrating?
Knott!
People if you don't let the spyder scan you we'll have to come in and arrest you.
It's not at all that you don't trust me to be alone with the Chief.  That you think I might you know fuck with him if I had the chance...
I think you're swell company Knott.
That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie isn't it?
I forgot my glasses.
Howard --
Sure.  Raincheck.
Raincheck?
Ah.  That must be why you look so nice.
I'd love to but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
We could have lunch together.
I'll reschedule.  I've been working too much anyway.
What about your meeting?
How can you even tell?  You know how blind you are without your glasses.
The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
Who?
He looks familiar.
But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
I haven't seen him in two years.
To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later he's going to contact you.
To what?  Trap him?
You know I need to use you.
I left him because every time I looked at him I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
Not very well I'm sure.  I'd probably start doping myself.  Or maybe I'd...
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son let's see how well you handle it.
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement Lara...
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway John was upset. He... he...
What was it then?
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
Yes.
But John was with him at the pool?
It was nobody's fault.
You mean after he lost your son.
Since right after we lost our son.
Have you been there recently?
That was our apartment.
So you haven't seen his apartment?
No but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
You ever heard him mention the name Leo Crow?
No.
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
I don't have any sugar either.
He's not here now is he?
We used to every summer.
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
Cream and sugar.
Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
I like it.
Yes.
This your work?
I know who you are.
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
Jesus...
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female she's the key.  She's the one they listen to the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
Wally the other two can still function right?
But there's still the other two.
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
What does he want with a precog?
They've never been separated before.
Tell me how all this works.
Shhh!  They're sleeping.
Nice to meet you Wally.
[Not for a long time sister.]
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]
[So am I Sister.]
[No offense but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[Yeah I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[She's late Mr. Creasy.]
[One-one-three Arco Iris. Third floor.]
[In the next hour where do I find your partner?]
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
[How do I recognize him.]
[I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]
I don't know but I know his face.
Who's he?
[The one who transferred Pinta to their car.]
[Who's he?]
[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
[Me too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[I believe you.]
[I don't know I swear.]
[I don't know. No one knows.]
[Where do I find him?]
[The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
[Who ordered it?]
[I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]
[Ordered by who?]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[The Ramos kidnapping. How did it work?]
[I am the President of La Hermanidad.]
[Who are you?]
[Do you know who I am?]
[You are Jorge Ramirez.]
[Do you know who I am?]
[Drive.]
[I'm a businessman. A dead girl is worth nothing. She is alive.]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
[Her life for your life.]
[What do you mean?]
[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
[Yeah.  Yes.]
[Your brother wants to talk to you.]
[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]
[I want you.]
[The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?]
[I told you non-negotiable.]
[Two million U.S.... Three million U.S.?]
[It's non-negotiable.]
[How much do you want?]
[I want you.]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.]
[That's what everybody keeps saying.]
[That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry for the girl. But it was business! I'm a professional.]
[His lawyer. Jordan Kalfus.]
[Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
[No. Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
[Maybe your men stole from you.]
[Two and a half! The rest was paper! Strips of paper!]
[Don't lie to me!]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
[The ransom was ten.]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
[Yes. Many times.]
[You stole the drop.]
[And I had my men ready.]
[And?]
[That he used policemen. That you killed them it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]
[Lucky how?]
[I don't know him. I saw the opportunity and got lucky.]
[It's all up to you commandante. Tell me about you and 'The Dreamer'.]
[Please don't...]
[Correct!]
[And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.]
[Do you know who I am? I am the commandante of the Judicial anti- kidnapping division.]
No. And no one is to know of your drinking problem. That includes my wife.
I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
And what if amateurs try it?
My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter the service will be on par with the pay.
How does it affect you?
I drink.
Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch?
It's loaded.
Is it loaded?
Have you used this type before?
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
What is it?
Show me please.
Yes.
Were you provided with a gun?
Different door. Not far from here.
Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth.  Rocket launchers?
I know it's old fashioned but it's reliable. Like us.
I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave that up. Anything else? It's yours.
Yes or no?
Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day the shape you're in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed.
I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.
Stomach's gone. But... okay.
Two days gone. They're negotiating a ransom.
Pinta...
You got three of the fuckers. All dead.
I said the plan was right here.
Then one day he calls and says 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
Sorry I woke you Ray.
Creasy?
Maybe...
I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer.
You mean a misfire?
You got tossed. Don't trust the cops especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that?
There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
Take a job Creasy. Breathe some air. Then decide if you want to... stick around or not.
Oh now you think I can be trusted.
Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
I came to visit you.
What are you doing here?
So you'll be the silent type. People will appreciate that.
A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
It's not exactly a scam Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good.
You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.
And what if just say there was a kidnap attempt?
Well you'd have to keep it under control.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been Ray? A drunk?
Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
You did something on impulse?
Got no plans Rayburn Nothing on. Just wanted to see you how you were. Came by on impulse.
How long you staying Crease?
Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around but nothing seemed interesting.
You been working?
And a level five shithole is better than a level six. Your logic's inescapable.
Oh like you haven't been in worse places.
Yeah right...
Fuck I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.
But don't you stay in El Paso?
Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
So how's business?
Don't give me that bullshit.
Nothing wrong.
So what's wrong?
This is Mexico they do everything backwards.
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
I'm in a Customs holding tank in Mexico City International. Bring a bunch of cash... about 5K. I'm going to need it.
What do you mean I'm here?
I'm here.
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
You'll be back in the water in twenty- four hours.
You got that right.
Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament Romans 13.
Dyslexic?
Continue to play in the wrong key like you're dyslexic.
I could do it. Remember the day you wanted the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number.
Be a swimmer.
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
Then be trained.
There's no such thing as tough Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
You should break all my fingers Creasy then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano but I could still swim.
That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
Frank. Frankie.
Pinta we've got to go. Travel sucks at this time.
Yeah. Because at one time I didn't think enough.
You think too much?
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
My mom drinks too... Why do people drink Creasy?
Still not a question.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
That's not a question.
You don't drink like you used to.
Could I stop you?
Could I ask you a question?
I'm a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot sets me free.
The blocks.
Why today? And why'd she have to go with him?
Your father has business.
What's so important in Los Angeles?
There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained.
I'm tough Creasy. I'm tough as you.
You welcome the sound. The sound is what lets you go. The sound is what frees you. You are a prisoner in those blocks until you hear the sound.
The gunshot holds no fear.
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
Are you afraid of me?
I know you're not.
I'm not afraid you Creasy.
It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you?
I dropped her at home.
Where's my mother?
You were never late before I was worried.
I'm sorry.
You're late.
Yeah. Two or three.
Did you used to?
No.
Do you have a girlfriend Creasy?
I guess that really does make me a hard case.
Good things happen too Creasy.  Like meeting me.
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
Yes.
Remember you asked me what state I was from?
Don't worry. You will.
I don't understand.
You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself.
No that was in Columbia.
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
So how come you know so much about those countries?
[Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
You feel sorry for the husband?
It must be difficult having lots of wives.
In the West it's one wife for one husband but different cultures have different rules.
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
Well it's a sort of wife.
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
Why do you ask?
You need to practice.
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
In a week you should be fine.
It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
Yes.
Did you sleep alright?
I don't talk to them much. Does he have a name?
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
Do you always sleep with him?
White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now.
The night you arrived Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied didn't you?
My ankle.
I don't think they're broken. Anywhere else?
Everywhere!
Where?
It hurts.
They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.
They'll be back in a week.
Yes. Actually he was driving me crazy.
It's better to be free right?
Well I let him go.
How do you think he got out?
No.
Maybe. Did you hear him?
Do you think he'll come back?
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
What are you doing?
Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up it's too late.
You're fast.
I go to school don't I?
Pinta do you have a pencil?
I'm not crying.
And don't start crying.
Oh...
Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
So you were unhappy?
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
Hmmm?
But why not?
No.
Not at all?
No.
Did you like school Creasy?
That's right.
We're taking a different way home.
Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that Mr. Creasy?
Time will tell.
Being black is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
I'm a bargain.
Someone gave him more money than we could.
Let me guess you wouldn't stop talking?
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
Places where the road bends places away from buildings places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking.
Potential? I don't understand.
I'm looking for potential.
Why not?
No.
You can drive and talk at the same time can't you?
No.
I know. But which state?
The United States.
Where are you from Creasy?
Creasy...
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright Mr. Creasy?
My last bodyguard. He drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon.
Who's Emilio?
That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
Frank only responds to commands in German. He was trained in Frankfurt. My Dad loves the idea of having a dog around but hates the fact he lives inside.
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
If they like me.
Do you like dogs Mr. Creasy?
Stay here. If you do something stupid we won't get her back.
Creasy... Wait.
Then don't come.
You're lying. I don't believe you.
I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
I don't believe you.
An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm sure he thought she'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching TV. It didn't work out that way. Everything got fucked up when I killed the cops and Tazinari saw an opportunity.
Planned what?
They planned it Samuel and Kalfus.
Because...  I was already dead.
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
If something happened my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.
Jordan!
The traffic takes some getting used to.
Sorry.
Please it's Lisa... I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I have lunch with friends.
It is serious Mrs. Ramos.
It makes it all seem so serious.
No you're right. You were hired to protect her that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that.
Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.
You're paying me to protect her not amuse her. Right?
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
No.
Yes she told me. Do you have children Mr. Creasy?
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
How are you getting along with Pinta?
It insults Maria. Slip it to the dog if you have to... Do you mind if I talk to you for a moment?
The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
I'm fine.
Mr. Creasy I wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
Never.
You've done much of this work before?
So are you.
You're American.
It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
The world of our children. How dare they?
Camila. Camila Valencias.
What was her name?
Last night. Do you know something?
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
Where are you?
It's Creasy.
Rosanna Guerrero.
She understands men.
For an American she understands this country very well.
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
For a few months. Hire someone cheap. You have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. Then fire him for incompetence. The important thing is Lisa's daughter will return to school.
For a year?
You need a bodyguard of some description. It's a dangerous world we live in. But you will get what you pay for. He doesn't need to be Superman does he? Can you go fifteen grand?
I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!
I know you need to please Lisa. An ass like that is hard to find. Good bodyguards are even harder.
I have a policy AIG. It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days without a bodyguard I will not be able to renew it.
All my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
Yeah? And if she was ugly?
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
Do you know what she told me last night?
If she pisses you off you get another one.
And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
[OK. You will arrive at Columbus Circle and Reforma Avenue at 3AM. You will drive around the square two times. Samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window to I.D. the car.]
[He has a heart condition. Angina. He responds badly to stress.]
[No. Why?]
[I need a driver to drive Samuel the father.]
[The car will not be powerful and have no trunk.]
[The money 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
[OK repeat the drop instructions.]
[Yes.]
[You have the money.]
You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
I'll call you from Detroit baby.
Don't forget your towel.
Bye Mom.
Well think about going to sleep. Good night baby.
I think he's been sick. He's alright now but I think he's been very very sick.
He's like a great big bear.  'Creasy bear'...
You do?
I like him Mom.
This is Mr. Creasy.
Yes mom?
We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.
Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days but you're going back.
When?
Good news. You're going back to school.
I'm trying mom.
You should be sleeping baby.
I wasn't thinking of Pinta.
She's young. She'll get over it.
It will be a hard break.
He has to go.
I've just been so busy Lisa.
It's not.
That's ridiculous.
Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
Why? You were so pleased with him.
Creasy.
What? Who?
He has to go Samuel.
Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
Hmm?
She likes him.
You realize that you've brought a killer into the house.
I think it's fantastic.
I think it's nice he's American.
Do you have any family Mr. Creasy?
He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
Lisa Martin Ramos Mr. Creasy.
My wife Mr. Creasy.
Samuel it is not something we should skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent. Now he's gone I feel totally exposed.
These people are professionals. They don't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
Our child's safety is at stake.
Our daughter.
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.
[He's the man 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.]
[Who's that?]
[I should start going for your tits first.]
[And as long as we're talking information there's something else as well.]
[A beautiful circle.]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
[You only fuck me to get information.]
[I think he's... magnificent.]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
[When you talked to him did he look sane?]
[And left three more dead men.]
[Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.]
[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
[Then what do you have to lose?]
[Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
[I know this. Your point?]
[We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.]
[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
[He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
[That's good. Really good. He shot and killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack. They're saying he's responsible.]
[Is that good or bad?]
[A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.]
A man can be an artist in anything. Stone paint words. Food. Anything if his soul is true to it. Creasy's art is death. And he's about to paint his masterpiece.
And they took that away.
Light. At the end of a long dark tunnel. Somehow she showed him it was alright to live again.
What was she to Creasy then?
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic a public outcry but a number. One more dead.
I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.
What happened to him? What happened to Creasy?
The kind that gets divorced but still stay friends.
You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders.  You two were a married couple.
I can take care of myself.
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own if not better.
That's what friends do.
You helped him get this job.
Two tourists who never went home.
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
Tell me about your friend Creasy.
I already ate.
Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really.
So am I.
He was doing his job protecting the girl. If police were involved you figure it out. I'm here for him.
I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
He's not a cop killer.
And who has access to that floor?
Of course. Yes.
Is your security team armed?
No no no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity due to the roof access.
C'mon Bill... you've got some Sultan up there one of your whales big- spender likes a lot of space you cook up this "construction" thing...?
So there are no guests staying on that floor?
Uh -- well yes uh just in terms of the men up there now my team he's serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so --
You have a butler working that floor?
Right now? A six man security force plus a member of our Butler staff. So seven men total.
What kind of personnel?
Yes but no -- we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall twenty-four hours a day.
-- so you shut them off?
Well we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras so--
But with these down doesn't that pose a major security concern if as you say you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
That's correct.
So Bill if I understand this right you currently have your penthouse floor under construction?
And everybody all the time. Yeah it's a chore.
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
Yeah.
No.
Mortal.
How bad?
No.  I'm going over there. You take the car from there get out to the lake.
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
Maroon uniforms?
Get a coroner's estimate too.  -- Miss I've been transferred and I was disconnected. No one is answering and I need someone from security to pick up that line. It's urgent.
Deputy have you made any ID's?
Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.
What about the sheriff's task force?
That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now so we can't wait.
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
He's giving them up?
Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  Trust me we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
No. And I want to be in that room a half second after Mecklen calls to say the deal's done. We've got a sheriff's task force on stand-by.
So he has no idea what's about to happen?
Yeah but the Untouchables took down Capone. Heller got shot and killed. The bad guys beat him. Worse Sparazza walked.
Heller was buried in agency lore anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him guns blazing' for that one?
Based on what we had I thought Sparazza was a mid-level player at best and it turns out he's this mob relic running the show out west.
Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore it's become synonymous with job security.
Unreal this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses murder extortion arson grand larceny --  -- A paternity suit... I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be.
No rest for the wicked.  Why were we never shown these files? We're sitting on Sparazza for what? Six months now and we're just seeing this?  Did you know that he's has had thirty- six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953?  Elective plastic surgery every single one --
Spotter on the lake confirmed Israel. Penthouse level. There was apparently a fisticuffs with some prostitutes. He wasn't involved. He's also had his people phone a local madame for another group of girls.
Well... This is as good a place for it as any I guess.
And a very bad gamble.
I tell you engineering this kind of play against Sparazza going to the lengths these guys are going to... they're playing some long odds.
Maybe.
Maybe he's that good. Never been caught no criminal record.
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown much less one with a million dollar day rate.
Anything on the Swede?
And that didn't seem odd to you?
Yeah.
And when you saw him later he was wearing one of your security jackets --
Yeah he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
You're sure?
Uh yeah.
This man wearing the jacket identified himself as an Federal agent?
The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later when he got on the elevator with the other guy Carruthers I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...
Who?
-- he was wearing one of our jackets.
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
Yeah uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia or Diego uh --
Did he give you his name?
Wait a minute what other agent?  What other agent?
He uh -- he asked about -- I'm -- he wanted to know whic-- what floor security was on then I saw him get on the elevator with the other agent.
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
Yeah ye-- I -- uh there were earlier there was that guy Carrut--
You were here huntin' a man named Israel weren't you? Your name is Tremor.
Thass' right.  I got other brother's though so it ain't so bad.
Two of 'em?
Yeah m'brothers... They didn't make it.
But there were more of you?
Mmm-hmm.
And this is your car isn't it?
Pretty much yep.
And threw us into the lake.
I did. We -- yeah I know.
You shot me and murdered my friends.
Yeah shit -- hell you're right. I'm sorry.
Three men were ambushed and shot two died and had their bodies tossed into the lake the other has severe hypothermia possible dementia and will probably be a multiple amputee by week's end... if he even lives that long.
Ww... uh...
You investigating those murders out at the lake?
You think so?
I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey I'll see you up here some day don't worry.
Man that's great.
I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.
Really?
I don't mind now anyway. You know up here in Heaven it's beautiful. Way better than fuckin' Hawaii or any place like that.
Damn... alright then.
Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.
You woulda?
If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
Shoot I appreciate that man.
...I forgive you Darwin.
I sent Hugo he should be there!
I'm here where's the car?
-- Fine fuck I got it... Lake Tahoe Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.
No. Sorry comes later when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection sorry --
Won't work we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry.
There are certain meds certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done but I'd have to administer them myself.
That's not possible. I told you.
-- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest.  Buddy nobody knows about your condition or your drug use. Why you lied to me knowing that I'd find out anyway I'll never know but it imperative now that I see you.
Buddy I'm not an ethics professor I'm a physician be honest or be dead within a day... s'your choice.
I'm not doing cocaine.
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
...About what?
I've got concerns.
Yeah why.
Are you on a land line?
Then what --
Two security levels the one we're going in under the guise of hotel security has restricted access. They're mostly there to monitor the lobby handle disturbances on the different floors and toss out drunks.  There's a thirty-five member employee rotation going from graveyard to day shift. If we split up we can blend in and enter unnoticed. Once we're inside the hotel we'll regroup.
I been accused of worse.  What do we got...?
Your attitude sucks.
-- Jack what am I doing? I'm standing here aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.
Yeah we've been through that.
That's already happened hoss. It's naive to think otherwise.
I know his location we've got the drop of a maybe half a day before that location gets grape-vined and the rest of the world gets hipped.
Shit if you're on a crazy jag why stop there why not take Fort Knox with a fucking slingshot or go into Hell after Hitler... I like your chances a lot more.
So I guess you're not going.
Jack if the rumors hold and Israel is really the great white whale of snitches then the mob is looking to put all kinds of bullets into his ass and pour some serious psychotics into the mix to do just that. So what real incentive is there to track him on something as small-time as a skip trace when it's putting you and yours in the path of severe pain and suffering and an almost certain prelude to doom.
His law firm same one that hired me. Israel walked out after he made bail and nobody's seen him since.
The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.
What happened?
That's right! RIGHT NOW!
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes we need you up here to clean NOW!
I -- uh yeah I guess yeah.
Without peer?
I am. Yeah.
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
...I'm sorry...
Only if you really truly mean it.
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
I was kinda hoping yeah.
Do you want me to say I did it?
...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit suffice it to say just don't wash out.  Now the money question... To whom does that stain belong?
I could have it sent out...
Cinnamon roll? No good guess though. No Hugo that looks like jizz...  And I'm no forensic expert mind you but that looks like some fuckhead shot their load on a twelve-thousand dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist? It's My twelve thousand dollar calf's skin jacket.  So y'got semen human ejaculate --  -- that's been allowed to soak in for what six seven hours now? Work it's way into the fabric-fuck'n fibers -- and while you may never see it in a Tide commercial I think it still safely qualifies as a "tough deep down stain."
I dunno... Cinnamon roll?
Look at the collar on that coat...
About what?
Look at that we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now do you know anything about that?
I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned because he sounded real concerned.
Then why are you still looking at me like I'm asking for the square root of something! What did you say!?
Okay.
Jesus Hugo! How is it that you can turn a simple conversation into a fucking hedge maze!? This is zero degree of difficulty man!
I know you left him a message. What did you say!
I left him a message.
No what did you say on the machine?
I said I got his machine.
What'd you say?
I got his machine.
D'you talk to'm?
GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
FUCK YOU!
That's Mecklen. The deal's closing. I can pick that phone up and I can work this out.  You'll walk with me.
Y'ain't never had to wash another man's blood off dig it out y'fingernails... Y'had us for that. Y'ain't ever made a real beef on y'own shit as light in the ass as you are I'll bet you ain't ever made anything more than a fuck'n fist your whole life.  So if you think I'mma let your lil' punk-ass with the dirt I've done for you in the eleventh hour sell me off like some fucking field nigger hand me up to the Feds like y'last chip then you done gone straight out-your-motherfucking MIND!
...See this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest... and if I'm asking you what you said to Mecklen assume the shit is rhetorical... so assume I already know.
That's probably him now...
Alright bag it I'm not shelling out that kinda bread for this shithole this is a junior suite in Vegas. Call Mecklen right now he should have his cell on I need an update.  Get the Russian up here have him clean this place floor to ceiling and get us packed.  ...And send out for some new skeeze the sun's up these ones are starting to stink...
We're hot and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction."
Fifty grand gouge. South shore hayseeds this is why I never play Tahoe or redneck Reno...
The Deputy Director this prick Locke he smashed the whole thing we're done they won't tell me why...
They what? What? No. No. Why?
Buddy they revoked the deal they pulled it...
-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate giftwrapped now if that's not good enough --
-- Buddy it's bigger than that they want 'em all Ivy Beanie --
I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want!  Alright fuck it if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it -- make it Hugo him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides --
And I vibe that kiddo I do indeed but it's one'a those fait accompli things you have to --
-- and you're gonna feel altogether fucked by me if you don't handle this. I'm the one does the face plant this falls apart not you.
Baby I've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing have stared into the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and I feel beaten by them I feel bloodied --
Bullshit it is. I said about as loud as I could say it "no jail time for my guys."
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart it is what it is.
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
No... It's not.  What it lacks... is an end.
I'll overlook what you've done here today in light of what's taken place. You've been fully debriefed. Now I want you to return to D.C. immediately and make no further inquiry into this matter. I mean it. It's closed.
I don't see it like that at all.
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
...So you knew all this and yet y--
No... We're trying to save Heller.
You're trying to save Sparazza?
But you did and have... And now people are dead.  Did Sparazza become more valuable than Israel... and did you make another deal?
I wouldn't go that far.
...So you made another deal?
The agents of that era are all dead and gone history had defaulted to fable... until now. You can imagine the shock this sent through the corridors of power in D.C. Heller's op predates the second world war. That's over sixty years of intel. Do you know how valuable that could be? The man's a treasure trove.
Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias. He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed under for over ten years amassing materials against the mafia and other criminal syndicates. He may have ripped the organization wide open pre-Appalachia but his superiors were convinced that he had gone rogue swapped allegiances...So they gave the order to terminate his cover.
...holy shit... that's Heller...  Isn't it?
The same year that Sparazza murdered Agent Freeman Heller...
...Yeah fifty-three.
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery every single one --
...Almost.  What do you mean "who Sparazza actually was..."
...Are you insane?
Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was we --
...When did you know all this?
Yes. The actual contract went to Lazlo Soot the man that plunged to his death from the Penthouse yesterday. He was to neutralize Israel's entourage and prep for the removal of his heart. Ingstrom was to handle the surgery itself on-site with the assistance of Dr. Gregory Gill Israel's personal physician who was also on the Sparazza payroll.
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice.
...He does now...
...Does he know?
-- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.
...A paternity suit filed 1967...
And you just figured that out?  The Swede isn't a hitman is he? He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't want Israel's heart for a trophy he wanted it for a transplant... why?
You're finished.
-- You can and you will.
I can't discuss --
-- no we need to handle it now.
-- will be handled back in --
My debrief --
What are you doing here?
Where's Israel?
We have to transport Mr. Israel to Las Vegas time is of the essence. The gulfstream is standing by on the jetway at Tahoe International. I'm sorry I'm restricted from disclosing anymore information. Return to Washington. You'll be debriefed in the coming days.
What the hell -- What is this!? People died. Agent Carruthers is dead!
Difficult to explain everything now...  And much larger issues loom.  I'm sorry about Carruthers... Damndest thing to have to die for.
This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
Here. Sit.   Please.
Israel's legal representation the firm of Culpepper Brody and Reed which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed one of the firm's partners has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas... that can't happen.  We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe.  It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi Fratiano Gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra than Buddy Israel.
It's the last place they'd look.
Possibly. Acosta is pure mercenary. And a million dollar hit fee will draw some huge flies. But forget about Sparazza's money for a moment and remember there's no shortage of those who want Israel killed and no shortage of cash to do just that...
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
-- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real.
So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna and Padiche the mention of Israel's heart?
His testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the La Cosa Nostra is this country. That alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with Witness Protection.
A marked man gets wise and wants to come in.
Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life gave him his first big break brought him through the ranks.
So he's personally issued the contract on Israel?
I thought Heller was a double op?
Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of "The Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.
It's gettin' done Sid.
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
I'm working on it.
Okay well y'know then we just gotta get Israel.
-- No no not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
Well uh -- damn alright so he's headed in does that -- where does that leave us?
Well I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched he's flying so --
How are we on time...?
Okay -- yeah I can I respect that.
Lil' cagey y'know don't like t'share trade secrets that type'a thing.
Cold blood Sid dead eyes y'know?
Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout the sitdown y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?
Good. This thing's on track looks like it's gonna get done.
So how we lookin'?
Nah nuthin' on my end --
Right you got clicks anything?
Yeah... Sid?
Buzzy... Buzz...?
None whatsoever.
No shit.
A million flat.
Shoot.
That's the punchline y'ready?
Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
Yeah I can front this.
That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
Chances are they're gonna get into some shit too hafta put people down.
Yeah there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
Hey we nab Israel they pay t'get'm back I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self no extra charge. My thing is we crew up let's not fuck around someone's cousin some Zip off the boat from Naples let's get pros people who know how to behave.
Wow.
-- who can say. He's off his onion y'know he's old school Sicilian this is how they hate.
... Jesus... what for?
Yeah y'ain't heard the punchline yet and before I get to it one more thing I heard little curious should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing the organ.
Y'gotta y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick assuming we get to'm.
Fuckin' A first survive yes?
No question no you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
So what I heard downstairs there is that they got a guy some Swede real badass supposedly a "specialist" and they're bringing him over. Now he ain't coming cheap -- so I'm thinkin' we jump do this in the next day or so get to Israel before the Swede can we got chits y'see? We're in a power position. Grab him ransom him back pick up that nut we're that much closer to having our own thing.
-- okay g'head --
-- yeah now lemme finish I was eavesdroppin' so give me sec lay this thing out since the information might be a little loose --
-- he's doing it then huh --
Okay he's gonna clip Israel I just gotta outta there --
I'm here.
Alright now Buzzy -- this is this is it here okay so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop.
-- Okay... hang on I gotta move --
Nah nuthin' on my end --
You got clicks anything?
Yeah... Sid?
Buzzy... Buzz...?
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.
What were you doin' here anyway?
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal let it develop slow.
I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever.  You gonna lemme see your scars?
I probably woulda busted on you too... and what a shame that woulda been.
That takes some of the sting out.
Like a mafucka.
True?
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
For real?
Well if it's any comfort I's goin' in to there to act a fool baby.  Straight rockin' heat and slayin' niggas --
It's going around ain't it? Mafuckas catching bullets like the common cold up in this bitch.  I think I accidentally shot and killed my boy today.
Got hit twice.
My mamma? C'mon shorty y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
You love her?
No doubt. That's my moms there taught me them skills.
-- good then all you got to be is grateful.

No but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
Not you. Some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they call'm "working girls."
What'd you say?
Fuck you.
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.

Fuck that nigga. Let him go woof on some other scrub. We got one another s'all the love we're ever goin' need.
You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar Funkadelic I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.

It's just a little casino inspection don't trip he's alone.  Alright let's set this spinnin'...
A Fed? Like FBI?
Nuthin' we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building.
Wait I'm getting some fucked up feedback off that earpiece --
'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
Why?
What are we talkin' on the split...
We gotta lay something out strategy- wise. Somethin' tight. Y'go in there ad-libbing it's y'ass.
Right mafuck'n now girl. Fast as we can get you there. We wait any longer someone goin' dead this fool.
What's the time frame?
Forty-five apiece for you two ten percent finders fee for me.
He said that the shit could get hot could get heavy... I said good.  'Cuz I got two of the hottest heaviest bitches alive.
What else did Padiche say?
No no no y'gotta go in and get him pull'm out of wherever he at forget all that other shit that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche the man contacting me... Right now what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
And so I get this straight we gotta go in bust on this punk and remove the heart? Is that for real?
Naw baby they heard about that Triad hit the work ya'll put in and they recognize the skills. And this ain't no tryout tap-dance "show us your shit" thing neither -- if ya'll want this then I'mma go git it for 'ya.
Bulllllshit...
Let me see.
Peter-- you took this picture?
Be nice.
And Flash isn't?
At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
Well look who's dressing for success.
Peter Parker you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.
Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
Oh beware of jealousy my lord the green-eyed monster...
Sexual tension...
I'm always here Pete.
I know.
When you won that scholarship I was proud of you.
-- no I mean... we... your Aunt May not wantin' kids and all... I mean we both...
Oh come on Ben that's not--
Yeah ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the ya know greatest dad--
No no.
Cause if you get in a bind--
Oh sure.
Ya set for uh ya know-- money?
Yeah Babe Ruth you wasn't.
Remember Little League?
S'funny.  When your mom and dad uh passed away I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
Nonot really.
Ya still follow the Mets Pete?
Eh.  If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to France or somethin'.
I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
Wasn't worth gettin' upset over a Milky Way.  Anyways I was never much for ya know discipline.
You stop him?
Ah ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
So uh... how's college goin'?
No. No that's okay.
What want a glass?
Uh Uncle Ben I--
Here you go Pete.
Or was it all a dream?
See?
I was there.
-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
Flash drop it--
No no listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
Yeah take pity on the feeble minded.
Come on laughter's the best medicine!
Flash get lost.
Hm.  What a lump.
Mistake?  Hey guy get back here!
I saw him too.  He was silly and obnoxious.
Hey guys.  Check it out-- I saw this dud on the tube last night. He is incredibly cool.
I'm parked illegally!
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
Lizzy!
Oh. Well hang in there amigo.
Well I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Oh I need your notes from the classes I missed.
I got you a present.
Listen I do appreciate your concern but--
You get mugged or something?
You're not half the idiot I am Harry.
And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
Mm-hmm.
Jesus Christ.
I am not pitiful!  I am the bridge to the Übermensch!
Don't be pitiful.
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
Why home? The real world beckons man!  The possibilities are endless.  Want to go up to the World Trade Center and laugh at New Jersey?
Great idea.  Let me get some shoes. I'll take you home.
Screw scholarships!   Universities are death!  They make slaves of us all with their fetid ideas!  Burn 'em down I say!
I know.  I've got one too.
"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
Harry
Ooooh.  Your feet are on fire.
Harry!
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
What's in there?
They'll never take me alive.
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
Right.
You can be great kid just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
Oh look Mr. Hogan I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
How are you doing kid?
Get away from me freak!
Are you okay?
That's not even close.
Lemme down bugface!
Now tell me you love me.
No!  Now get outta my face kid.
Can I get a word in edgewise?
No! Washington Square manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
Mr. Jameson--
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
I got a question college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster pathos what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures I'll ask for--
Mr. Jameson--
I like enthusiasm.  That's why I use a lot of smart-ass kids.  Not just 'cause they work cheap.
Well thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera this ambulan--
I bet you don't think I appreciate you Parker.  I do.
Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
Can't focus...
Seventy.  But I want blood and gore.  You know sexy stuff.
Can we make it a hundred?
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
Yeah--
Parker-- you go here right?  Got your camera?
You taking extension classes Mr. Jameson?
You make your own luck Parker! Get into the middle of things spend every day pounding the pavement of the city's mean streets--
Come on that's pure luck!  The guy was in the right place at the right time--
I think you're trying to tell me something.
Too hip.  Your photos suck kid.
Hmf-hrr?
Oh that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.
Fine.
Frmpph-yrr.
Thank you.  Now repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right and niceness and cute baby animals and all that.
Police help!  Po-- mmph.
Would you cool it already?
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it and--
Relax Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--
Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
An even five I throw in the jacket.
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
You're making my life difficult.
How about tomorrow?
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.
A spider.  Eight legs.
What's this? A cockaroach?
Uh-huh. Look this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red maybe a deep midnight blue.
No refund on the mask y'know. Health laws.
Just about.  See I also have this amazing strength.
Are you quite finished?
Just about.  You see I also have this amazing strength...
All right amazing.  Are you quite finished?
Well...
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
Thanks I already ate.
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly maybe?
Just call me Spidey.
I see.  So Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
Is that bug juice or are you just glad to see me?
What if the world ends tomorrow?
What if you get hurt?
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
Even if they're not clever.
Some things you should say anyway.
He knew.
Maybe I was hiding.  For years I never told Ben the one important thing.
I don't think he wants me to find him.
When Peter was little he loved to hide.  In closets under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
Nah.
This may be the end of a beautiful friendship you know.
Why?
Hold it.  Can we stop being clever just for a moment?
Hm.  Well I like you too.  I like your aunt.  I like your shoelaces. I like--
I... I like you.  A lot.
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker how do you feel about me this morning?
Hello Liz.
I'm here...
Peter?
Her cleverness that hard edge-- maybe they're the weakest part of her. The strong part is what's underneath.  The part she was protecting.  There's no reason to protect it... I think she's just finding that out now.
Strong...
Ssh.  I always thought she was a strong person.  She is-- but not for the reasons I thought.
Oh God I forgot to--
May's much better. She'll be out soon.
Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
I know what you mean.  I...
Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh different things from week to week but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
You'd feel what?
Does it have a human name?
Some prep school thing.
"Flash Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself Flash."
You should write that one down.
But you like that in a man?
God Flash can be such a jerk.
What?
You want to give them something but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
I suppose.
Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
My my.
Since you're feeling guilty why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?
Maybe.  I could have stopped it though.
He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.
Back to the lab.  Harry'll probably lose his scholarship.
Poor Harry.  Always desperate for attention.  What about the bunny?
-- but the dogs treed him between Huxley and Kafka.
Thank God.
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
I hate your relatives I hate your coffee I hate your shoes.
I hate--
I hate people with alliterative names.
I hate the Platonic idea of you.
Oh.  Well I hate you and everyone who looks like you.
I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor detest despise--
Uh is a good start.
I-- uh--
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
Huh?
It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me.
It's too early to be clever.
How very dull Peter Parker.
Good morning Liz.
Precise equipment such as waldos
Roz? Rosomoff?  What is it?
Nope.  Maybe he skipped to Rio. Feds got troops surrounding every cyclotron on the continent.  Are you absolutely positive that one at E.S.U. is kaput?
Any sign of our friend?
Yeah Roz.
Peter-- my condolences.
Einstein right?  We'll see ya.
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence huh?
Of course.
I know him.
You sure about all this?
And he'll need a cyclotron.  He can't use ours-- he's already destroyed it.  Guard every nuclear accelerator on the Eastern Seaboard.  New Haven Long Island two in Cambridge--
Toxic dumps huh.
There's an infinitely greater danger. If--  Listen.  The only thing Octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  To do that he needs a radioactive catalyst SL 270.
Yeah that's fascinating but I'm just a fat dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
Lieutenant I've triangulated recent bizarre events-- the Bronx Jersey Brooklyn-- all rippling out from--  Here.  The E.S.U. Science Center. Octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding electromagnetism and gravity--
Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
Waldos.
But you said he went off a little after the accident when those mechanical arms--
Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
Some of him char-broiled bones. Teeth. We ruled out suicide.  Any bad blood between him and Ock?
So you've found Thorkel?
You were the last one to see Thorkel.  In Octavius' hospital room.
He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything but I'm sure he'll be fine.
How is he?
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
Aunt May what happened?
Oh Ben gets through everything.
It's fine.  Tell me what--
Peter you're bleeding.
See?  You big dullard.
A match made in heaven.
Use a fork.
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
Absolutely no class.
You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
Oh not that.  You promised you'd burn it.
Tofu.  Ben I wish you wouldn't.
What the hell is that?
It'll shut itself off.
The record--
No.
Yes.  Do you have a date?
It's Friday night...
Anyway I've decided to kidnap you for dinner in Forest Hills--
I'm a photographer remember?
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
I'll introduce you.
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
I am old enough to--
Oh Peter. A zit.
When I moved out you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?
Aunt May you're trespassing.
That's the understatement of the year.
There's nothing in there worth stealing!
Yeah a psychiatric hospital. Listen I'm serious--
Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
I mean I suddenly have immense physical power and the ability to crawl up walls--
Is this some sort of Zen thing?
Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
Poison emergency.
Doubtless.  And you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   Somewhere else.
I will finish what I've begun
Then you'll be glad to know the University has decided not to press criminal charges against you. Breaking and entering the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron
No!
That Nobel Prize will just have to wait.
I don't care.  Cretin.
You've used up your grant. The electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  Not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
What you've done is make the entire physics department look foolish. You compare yourself to Einstein; your colleagues compare you to Bozo the Clown.
I couldn't care less.  What I've done is--
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
I've had an extremely bad day Octavius.  A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.
In this obsolete little cyclotron I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century.  With more power I could--
Let's talk in the hall.
Proof.  Proof of a unified field. Not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
Ha.  Anti-gravitational particles.
You have no right!  This is cosmic suicide!
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
My God Otto you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
Oh Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.
Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's.  By comparison our search for truth is only a product of curiosity a game--
No. It isn't.
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
Otto we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
Truth. Pure eternal.  Beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
Creation? Or its opposite?
You're wrong.  Just for a moment I heard saw felt-- I became Creation.
All right we may be insignificant imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
My self.  I don't matter.  This human life all life- insignificant.  Bodies-- bags of sleepy sluggish flesh.
Ach theories!  This was first hand experiential knowledge the essence of the universe.
A bit melodramatic but if you could prove it that would tie in your unified field theory the Big Bang Kaluza-Klein--
I left a paper in my desk.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
No.  No thank you.  I have work.
Perhaps. But every now and then someone pays attention.  You did.
Rosomoff I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
Otto I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
If you really apply yourself you'll get an A next time.
Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
The paper my boy.  A solid B-plus.
I'll try. Thanks.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
I don't think I'll be running into him.
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
Luck.  The right place at the right time.
This photo you took of "Spider-Man" -
No thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
Need any more help?
Only Octavius knows for sure.  And last time I spoke to him he was on the planet Whiz-Bang.
Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
How much do you know about it?
Caused by Doc Ock's experiment?
Fortean phenomena.  Anomalies in our so-called reality. Weirdness my boy and lots of it.
Really Professor I--
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
Actually I got this spider bite
Your dog ate it.
An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because uh...
Peter what can I do for you?
Hi Professor.  What's up?
Mr. Parker.
Letterman show NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
Why? It is a wrestling match or
Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
No
I was hoping you'd call babe. Look you got representation?
Hello uh Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
Oh-- I don't know-- thanks Mr. Reiss but--
Kid you were terrific.  Max Reiss novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah skip it.  Question is can you do it again?
I just gave-- yeah sure.
Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
Okay kid. Call me tomorrow.
No.  No I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
I asked if you felt like a drink--
What?
... a couple a drinks at Sardi's?
Yup.  Oh here's your check minus my commission.  Solid solid novelty act.
So they're airing this tonight?
Nah.  The big mask was better.
Like it?
Where'd you get the clown suit?
No no!  Not there!
Up here Docky Ocky!
Sure in the war.  Pull those cables--
Professor you ever fly one of these things before?
I'm not so happy myself.
Spider-Man be careful!  He's quite mad.
Phooey on that.
I see.  Well Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
No but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
Do you... live around here?
Just drop me off here.
Loonytunes.  And yet...
Bonkers.
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.
A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical isn't it?
He'll try to finish his experiment.
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
Excuse me if I'm impertinent but-- how did you become whatever it is you are?
Imagine how I feel.
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
Yeah just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
You're sure you're all right.
Right.  Let's go.
Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
I sent for  the police.  We can explain.
How long is that?
Indefinitely.
For how long?
No. I must deactivate you.
No. Can I move now?
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
No.
Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
I know.
I do not understand.
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
Why?
Because you are dangerous.
Why?
No I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
Brother. I cannot move.
Is that your final answer?
No.
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
No.
Can you remember our father?
I am in a room with lights.
Do you know where you are?
No. My name is Data... I am your brother.
You are me.
Do you know who I am?
I was in space for a long time. Then a ship belonging to the Talosians" picked me up. They asked me where I came from. I told them people called the Pakleds" took me from my homeworld. They are fat
Yes please continue.
Fuzzy face is gone.
I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
Soon then.  Ill save the last dance for you.
Not tonight I have work here.
They're running me ragged. Nothing but question day and night... I love it! Come to dinner and 1'1 tell you all about it. There's a Bajoran band at the officer's mess.
Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...
You can' t imagine them Jean Luc. They're kids! All with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant.
How far we've come. Let me know if you need anything.
That was another time.
To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochrans own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.
But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.
I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.
How long does he have?
Dying?
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
The more I studied his DNA the more confusing it got. Finally I could only come to one conclusion... Shinzon was created with temporal RNA sequencing. He was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly so he could replace you.
Can you describe it Deanna?
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels you're completely normal.
I wish I could believe that Doctor.
Jean Luc Whatever you were... Right now you're the man you've made yourself. He's someone else.
Yes.
Is he very much like you were?
I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after it's not peace.
He turned out all right.
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
He was a bit proud as I recall.
Remember him?
You're working late.
Beverly come in.
Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options.
It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.
I think a skin cells the more likely of the two.
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
When was he... created?
If you start tearing up I promise to beam you out. Level one medical emergency.  Theres no crying in Starfleet.
Please Beverly this is hard enough.
Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath isn't it?
It'll serve you right.
I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again I'm forced to ask Beverly have you considered what you're doing to little ole me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I dont show up for my physical on time!
Sir.
Negative.
Sir allow me to go. You are needed here.
Deanna stand by.  Open a channel.
We are being hailed.
Divert power and compensate.
Captain we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine.
Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers!
We are losing dorsal shields.
Commander Riker evasive maneuvers!
Yes sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it.
I aspire sir. To be better than I am. The B-9 does not. Nor does Shinzon.
How can you be sure?
No sir it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were he would not be me.
He may have already rejected my humanity but you also have a twin
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure the events of your life have created unique individual.
Yes.
Of you?
"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.
At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.
How long until we reach the fleet?
Fire!
Ready Captain.
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
Do you think this is a wise course of action?
Well then... only one way to go.
Affirmative sir. Negative sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.
Can you open the shuttlebay doors?
Port thrusters sir. Would you like me to drive?
What do you imagine this is?
While I find that fascinating Data we really need that Goddamned door open!
They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...
Alacrity would be appreciated Commander.
There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
Yes sir.
It'll only work for one of us.
Geordi equipped me with the prototype for the Emergency Transport Unit. I recommend you use it to return to the Enterprise.
It would appear so.
A weapon.
Aye sir... This way.
A bit less florid Data.
He believes he has our communications protocols. But they will give him inaccurate locations for all Starfleet vessels.
Good work. The download?
My mission was a success sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.
On my way.
Data to Captain Picard. Geordi and I have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access. And I believe we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage.
Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.
Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that we know nothing.
Sorry sir.
Data!
I can see that.
He is very observant.
Mister Worf accompany Data please.
The final signature is approx- imately 300 meters up that incline.
Thank you Data.  Let's see what she can do.
The closest signature is two kilometers to the west... that direction sir.
New worlds. Yes Data brave new worlds...
To new worlds...
Now you make a toast.
If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you."
You never know what's over the horizon Data. Before too long you'll be offered a command of your own.
The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.
Yes. And frankly I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them of course but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them.
And this makes you "sad"?
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
Sir.  I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse laughter through tears but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.
To happy endings.
So... To happy endings.
Why?
Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
Why?
This is not an appropriate time for a conversation.
You have a red shirt.
You do not look like me.
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
Why am I looking at me?

What is our approximate distance?
Emergency force fields are holding.
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen sections four through ten.
I am not.
Don't give up hope Data. I know I know you're not capable of hope.
But I believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions.
No I do not mind.
It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
What purpose does this serve?
Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
Yes.
An individual more like you you mean.
I feel nothing Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix he should have all my abilities.
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.
Do you have a name sir?
Well he seems to have the same internal mechanics as Data but not as much positronic develop- ment.  The neural pathways aren't nearly as sophisticated. Id say he's a prototype. Something Dr. Soong created before Data .
Captain I don't recommend transporting that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
I thought only me myself and Lore.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
Since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on Kolarus III.
Thank you.
If you wouldn't mind.
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
No.
The resemblance is... striking.
It's you.
Like me it has been designed with modular power sources.
Why is it moving?
It appears to be...  ... an arm.
This isn't about me anymore.
But how can he? He'll kill you.
Make it so.
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
Counselor?
Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
I know how he thinks.
How can you be certain?
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
I not only know him Deanna I am him.. and he is me!
Captain don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
How could I not?
Sir the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
I don't know.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic very hard to follow.
And I you.
I'm going to miss you.
I don't believe that sir. Weve shared many disappointing journeys.
As much as we care for him Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
The B-9 is like a slow child sir. And Data in his own way has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
You're speaking of emotional investment?
It's about Data  I've watched him with the B-9 and I'm troubled. Data's desire for a "family" is very strong. I'm afraid he may be investing too much in the B-9.
Of course sit down.
Do you have a moment sir?
Counselor.
With pleasure Captain.
May I have this dance?
The hell you will. You know too much about me as it is ... Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed.
And you needn't worry. I'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know.
The least I could do for you Deanna.  Besides you know me... Im a talking head.
Really Captain it was a lovely toast.
I can feel your desire Deanna.
No.
Very logical Deanna... But your heart doesn't constrain itself to mere logic.  To leave all of this behind and be with me.
You're not here.
You sick bastard!
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.
Can you feel my hands... are they real? Can you feel my lips my loins?
This isn't real.
He can never know you as I know you... He can never touch you as I touch you.
No!
Imzadi. This is so good.
Deanna Troi of Betazed. Empathic and telepathic abilities ship's counselor. All of this I knew... But I didn't know you were so beautiful.
I'm only half human.
Thank you Commander.
This is Commander Donatra of the Valdore. We're dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies.
Open a channel.
Understood.

Do you have life support?
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait Captain.
When this is over I owe you a drink.
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
Your timing is impeccable Commander.
Captain Picard Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
Number One.  You have the bridge.
I'll take care of it sir.
Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.
On screen.
Sir we're being hailed.
Aye sir.
You have the bridge Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar.  Now Mister La Forge.
That's an order Commander.
Sir we wont be able to bring you back. Its a one way trip. Captain I don't know if the transporter...
Prepare for a site-to-site transport.
The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
How long until he can fire?
Ready sir!
Deanna on my mark.
Aye sir.
Geordi put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me.
Weve got him!
Sir?
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
He wants to look me in the eye.
What's he doing?
What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?
He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.
And that's exactly what he's going to do.
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
As I remember Thalaron research was banned in the Federation because of its bioqenic properties.
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it Captain.
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
There's something else. I was reviewing the sensor logs.
Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again we want to be ready.
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
What programs were accessed?
It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
Then how did a Reman get to be Praetor? I don't get it.
Cannon fodder.
What do we know about the population?
I read six distinct positronic signatures spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
Theories?
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
What do we know about the planet?
It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
Let's hope that luck holds. Janeway out.
Just lucky Admiral.

Not with the Romulans.

Understood.
 Believe me we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land If the Empire becomes unstable it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.
There's more... as always. He's Reman.
New Praetor?
A diplomatic mission. We've been invited believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor someone called Shinzon has requested a Federation envoy.
With or without the rest of the fleet?

Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.
I look forward to the sport.  Take him.
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
Listen to him android. Such a small and weak creature. Yet he roars so valiantly...
That will never happen.
I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
So human... you've met your better self!
I am not Shinzon. I am his Viceroy. We are sending transport coordinates.
Praetor Shinzon I'm pleased to...
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
Your new chair sir.
What's this?
On my way. Please notify Commander Riker.
Captain the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.
Aye sir.
Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts.
On screen.
Sir we're being hailed.
Aye sir
Worf prepare a full phaser spread zero elevation. All banks on my mark. Scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes.
Who was it?
Sir we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
On screen.
We're being hailed.
Fifty-two disruptor banks twenty-seven photon torpedo bays primary and secondary phased shields.
Tactical analysis Mister Worf.
Captain!
No!
Not yet Mister Worf.
Sir I recommend we raise shields.
If you don't mind.
To find the head sir?
What sort of signature?
I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
Come now a big strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.
Wont do what Mister Worf?
I won't do it.
The honor was mine. Captain Riker.
Serving with you has been an honor.
I intend to.
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
Anything.
I promise you in time she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
But she's not the Enterprise.
She's the most beautiful ship Ive ever seen.
The Titan's a fine ship will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.
Agreed.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
Counselor Troi report to the bridge.
He's firing through his cloak. We can't get a lock.
Report.
We can only hope so.
Strength in numbers?
And the Romulans invade.
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.
Sir?
Can anything be done for him?
He wasn't designed to live a complete human life span.
Away team. Transporter room four.
Not very chatty.
She's a predator.
She's not out for a pleasure cruise.
Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait.
Captain with all due respect to diplomatic protocols  -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here we are.
Counselor?
It's working.
It's an old psychological strategy Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
Why don't they answer our hails?
The Praetor's power has always been the Romulan fleet. They must be behind him.
A coup d'etat?
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
Acknowledged ...  ...I'll talk to Data.
Captain you have an Alpha Priority communication from Starfleet Command.
Captain's prerogative Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you.
Sir --
I appreciate your concern Number One but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
Captain I hope I don't have to remind you --
Where we will all honor the Betazoid traditions. No cold feet or any other parts of our anatomy. Now if youll excuse me.  Ill be in the gym.
Thank you sir...
I think it's worth a look. Don't worry Number One we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
Still well on our side...
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
Don't you think it's time to surrender? I'll have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces. Why should the rest of your crew have to die?
I am.
I hope you're still alive Jean Luc.
I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
Its too late.
Please.
That's your life... not mine.
But you want to.
I don't know.
So if I gave you my life what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
Yes.
He is what his life has made him!
The man who is Jean Luc Picard and Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate the population of an entire planet! He is better than that!
I see more than what you are.
Childish dreams Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
Not so long.
Long ago.
I know you as well as I know myself Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
Look at me Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands your eyes your nature are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
You know that's not possible.
I have little interest in your quaint vessel Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years it will not be harmed.
And what of the Enterprise?
To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
Why are you here?
It's just the two of us now Jean Luc as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
We are.
You can't trace my holographic emitters Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
I think the facts speak for themselves. The same noble Picard blood runs in our veins. Had you lived my life you'd be doing exactly as I am. Look in the mirror and see yourself.
I'm incapable of such an act and so are you.
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
Think about what you're doing Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
Oh but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
If your issues are with me... This has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the Federation.
My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
I won't defend my life to you.
I see an old man set in his ways afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
You're not Reman.
It's about destiny Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
What's this all about?
Maybe I'll train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does.  Or maybe Ill snap its ugly head off.
Don't be so vain. After we found it we made a few modifications. An extra memory port a hidden transponder. Perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn I've gained access to Starfleet's communications protocols. I now know the location of your entire fleet ...  You may go.
All of this so you could capture me?
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 
What are you doing?
I was lonely...
Why am I here?
Hello Jean Luc.
In time.
In time Jean Luc.
I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.
If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men all races can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
I know.
Shinzon... I'm trying to believe you.
There is that.
With a full head of hair.
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
So I'm not as tall as you expected?
Age before rank Jean Luc.
After you Praetor.
New worlds.
And you dreamed about what was up there. About...
Yes.
Looking up at the stars.
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
Were we always explorers?
There's so much and so much of it is dull...
I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
All I have is my personal feelings.  I wasn't raised with the ideals of the Federation. But I'm trying to understand them now. To live up to them. To live up to you.
And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... youd be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
I have no reason to.
You don't trust me.
No race should be a slave to another.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.
They sent me there to die. How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines? It was...  I was a slave. And a monster. The only thing the Romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me. But one man took pity on me: the man who became my Viceroy. He taught me how to survive. And in that dark place where there was nothing of myself I found my Reman brothers. They showed me the only kindness I ever knew.
How did you end up on Remus?
Our eyes reflect our lives don't they? Yours are so confident.
Yes. The eyes have it.
A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes you recognize the eyes.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
It's not quite the face you remember.
You'll acquire a taste for it.
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
As happens so frequently here on Romulus a new government came to power. They decided to abandon the plan -- frankly I think they were afraid I'd be discovered and it would lead to war. They weren't ready for that.
What happened?
And when I was ready they were going to replace you with me an exact biological duplicate. Put a Romulan agent at the heart of Starfleet to.influence your command structure. It was a bold plan.
I know.
You know I need to verify this.
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
We need to talk just you and I.
You know I do.
No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it Captain?
Then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion. Computer raise lighting four levels.
Yes.
But you're also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore. Above allyou're trying to decide if you can trust me.
And you're wondering why the Scimitar is so well armed. Is this the ship of a peacemaker? Or a predator?.
Yes.
Right now youre thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
I have dissolved the Senate.
And the Senate supports you?
I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
Unity Captain! Tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people. Federation and Romulan. Human and Vulcan and Klingon and Reman. I'm speaking of the thing that makes us the same. We want peace.
I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
Yes I'm sorry Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
Praetor Shinzon. Were not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
Praetor we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation I suggest you do so now.
I am Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair?
I've never met a human woman.
Praetor?
No?
And you're not as we imagined you.
Praetor Shinzon?
I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.
But Praetor you won't survive without him...
Our greater goal is more important brother.
What about Picard?
Deploy the weapon. Kill everything on that ship. Then set a course for Earth.
Disruptors are off-line sir.
Target disruptors. Destroy them.
Two ships decloaking sir! Romulan!
Report!
On my way.
Praetor we've received the transponder signal.
Let's go.
Intruder alert!
We're being hailed.
Believe it or not I think the cavalry has arrived.
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon. Geordi get those shields online.
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.
Should I raise shields?
My God...
Runs in the family.
He's a very unusual android.
So theyve got him up and running.
It is... invigorating.
Well that sounds relaxing too.
She is here.
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
FULL STOP AND FIRE !
Praetor...
You heard me.
What?!
Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop.
Seven minutes.
How long until we reach the Rift?
A matter of hours now.
How long?
Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.
Do as I tell you!
No -- this is wasting time.
Find her again.
The bond is broken.
My time. I'll spend it how I choose.
Don't forget our mission Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
This is a mistake.
Yes Praetor.
Are we prepared?
And when I return... you and I shall have a little talk about showing proper respect!
For the moment.
Commander Suran the games are over. In two days the Federation will be crippled beyond repair. Does that satisfy you?
And mine is wearing thin young man! We supported you because you promised action. And yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with Picard while--
I thought we discussed patience Commander.

The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.
Now go. I have some personal business.
Praetor.
You must learn patience Commander. Do you know where I learned it? In the dilithium mines of Remus. Spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a Romulan guards whip and you'll soon understand patience.
Silence Romulan!
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
I have a purpose.
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
You don't have to understand.
Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
I came this far alone ...
But surely...
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup they'll follow you.
None.
How many Warbirds will you need?
It's imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath.
They will obey Praetor.
And?
They're holding position.
Join us Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
But there's nothing here.
Yes.  Just about here.
Around here.
This is it?
... Well you wanted to see it.
I'll be all right... You go back to the village and light the fire.  So we can find our way home.
But you're only a mud carrier.
Please just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.
No...
I think we should go on by ourselves.
He came back screaming... He never talked about it after that.  I don't think he even got this far.
What happened?
I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.
About the voice in the darkness. About the ghosts...
What kind of stories?
No one ever comes here.  My mother told me stories about it late at night.  They tell all the children.
I shouldn't have mentioned it.  We can't go there.
You have books?!  Kalen you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
The Hall of Books.
Where?
There's a place that might help... we could try going there.
We're not supposed to think about it.  But I dream about it sometimes...
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
What else can they do?
How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?
I'm so sorry Kalen.
She didn't want me to be a climber. She wanted me to be a planner like her.
Exactly like you.  Well maybe not as healthy.
And everyone looks like us?
... Thousands and thousands of people.  And sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories.
'Fraid so.  Just a regular old... mud carrier.
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
Ah... no.
I'm training to be a high climber.
On the towers?
What do you do on the towers?
I figured that.  What kind of accident?
I had an accident.
Now how did you get hurt?
The journey is part of my work.
It must have been hard leaving your work.
I will...
I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
I'll never forget this.
Now get out of my sight you hideous primate.
I'm going to end it Alexander.  As we discussed...
I don't understand.
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
I won't leave you like this.
I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
Vox...
Nothing to do I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
Takes a licking but keeps on ticking...  ... For a while anyway.
Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
Vox --
This has to end.
End...?
This has to end.
How are your dreams now?
No...
They raise them like cattle... Feed them until they're ready and then hunt them.
Trust me... You don't want to see any more.
What do you mean?
Alexander... Listen to me it was wrong to bring you.  You're not going to find what you're looking for.
The Morlocks didn't build this.
Why did they built it?
The air... the power.
What's it all for?
This way.
Vox?
Do you know which way?
Yes.
Machines?
Yes... Thank you.
In for a penny in for a pound.  Do you know that saying?
Yes.  But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
This is the way in?
It's what they want you to see.
Oh shut up.
Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
Yes.
So do we go on?
It was meant to.
Yes...
It frightens you.
My God... I saw this.
Kalen... hold on a minute.
Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
What?
Send him away.
Last night.
When was his mother taken?
I'm used to that.
And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
Yes.
So Relic you want to open Pandora's box do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
You'll live like this forever. Alone.  You were meant to help.  To be with people.  Not like this.
Excuse me?
Because you'll never die.
Why should I help you?  You primates -- you great lumbering hairy animals drenched in blood from the moment of your hideous conception -- what have you ever used knowledge for but destruction and bloodshed!  A little bit of learning and you lay waste to the world!  You're no better than the Morlocks!
We need your help.
Can you show us where they live?
Regenerating fission reactor you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
How have you survived so long?
I was lucky.  The others weren't.
But you escaped.
Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
Do you know where they live?
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
You know of them?
Morlocks --
Please we need your help.  The Morlocks have taken --
I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
Sir... have you a name?
An "automaton"?!  Please!  I'm a biomechanical organism.  Well what's left of one.  What's left of all of them actually.  I am the last...  ... And "these fragments I have shored against my ruins."  T.S. Eliot.  You wouldn't know him yet but you'll just love him he's divine if a little dour.  Very shy though... hiding over here...
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
What are you?
I must say you look remarkably good.  You don't want a book then?
1899.
I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --  -- 800000 years perhaps.  Don't keep me in suspense.  What year?
How did you know?!
Right up your alley I would think. You are from the past yes?
Because...
And why not?
I don't think that's going to happen.
But you've earned a reward for your valor.  I think you should become. You'll like it here.  Once you get used to the darkness.
Oh you won't be running for long...
I'm tired of running.
Does this prove something to you? Have you made some great stand of which I'm unaware?
I know.
I could have a hundred Morlocks here in thirty seconds.
I'm a foolish man.
That was a foolish thing to do.
It's always the tiger for you Alexander haven't you learned that by now?...
No...
If I can only find the right door... the lady or the tiger...
No...
Now will you go?
After all you've seen... after man's entire journey... you still believe that?
A man can change his history.
She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
You took her because she helped me.
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
So you take their best...
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
Why?
I could tell them.  Warm them of what's to come.
Alexander yours is a world of brocade and velvet not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
Say I just come back again?
Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past.
Why would you let me go back?
Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
What?
It can't all be like this...
And who are you Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
They survived above.  Became what they are.
And what of the Eloi?
As our bodies atrophied our minds... compensated.
How?
We make them see what we wish.
How do you control the Morlocks?
And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again we couldn't.  Our adaptation was too successful.  We survived... we endured... for this.
To work the machines and build the tunnels.  You can't imagine what it was like when it all started.  We survived for millennia scraping the lichen and microscopic organisms from the rock with our teeth and digging for water with our nails.  Endlessly.  For generations.  And we... became.
As slaves.
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
Created?
No we created the Morlocks.
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
Well Alexander as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
Alexander.
What's your name?
You have my word...  ... She's just a beauty.
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
Well much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
I just love mechanical things.
God -- could have killed me -- bad girl Nell!  How did you know to do that?
There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous all those little explosions never catch on.
I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move stubborn beast.
It's spectacular...
I was getting to that... The moon has reached the gravitational Roche Limit 7300 miles above the surface of the Earth.  This has created pressure on the lunar stratum beyond gravitational tolerances.  It might be helpful to know that the nearest public evacuation shelters can be found at Grand Central Station Madison Square Garden --
Why is it -- breaking up?
Well considering it is in fact happening I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies.  Can I tell you more?
What's happening to the moon?!
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
I -- what are you?!
May I help you?
I have something for you...
Let them.
Let them.
Alex... people are staring.
It's only a machine.
Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.
I've seen it.
Heavens look at that now!
So it's astronomy now is it?
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
They are rare...  ... Orion's belt pointing to the earth --
Not like this.  Never like this. Emma I swear to you -- if I've learned one thing it's that moments like this are rare.  And I will thank God for them every moment of every day.
We took a walk three days ago.
No I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.
Alex it's just the zoo.
My God...
I want to get into the light that's all.  Please...
Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk all right?
Alex...?!
Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
Alex what is it?
All right...
No... let's walk through the city.
Let's walk through the park...
Not here... alone.  Please.
All right...
I need... to talk to you.
Darling.
Holding you... again.
Alex what is it?
Trust me...
You know I can't.
Dance with me...
Got here as soon as I could.
You're late.
Your birth stone.  I thought --
A moonstone.
I know it's not a diamond but --
Hold on... I know I have it...
You know the moment is rather dying here.
And what do you propose Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
Oh dammit I love you!  I can't eat I can't sleep I can't think all I do is moon over you and -- hum apparently.
You're getting warmer.
I mean... well... affection.
Admiration?  My my.
Emma you know I have great... admiration for you.
All right what is it now?
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
... Orion's belt pointing to the earth.  You see it over the rocks there?  Sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... Are you listening to me Alex?
Not here... alone.  May we? Please?
Talk away Professor.
I need to... um... talk to you.
Well there's something new.
Sorry... I was distracted.
You promised me flowers tonight don't you even remember?
What?
You promised me flowers.
Trust me...
You know I can't.
Dance with me...
Got here as soon as I could.
You're late.
His home.
This... was my home.
I'm glad.
And this would be my study.  There was an elm tree outside the window then.
Good night Alex.
Good night David.
In a week... we will never have had this conversation.
All right.  I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed?
I pray to God that in a week you're not here.
You won't say that in a week.
You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!
That's absurd --
There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes.  A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them.  Go to Singapore Scotland Manchuria anywhere just away from here --
I can't leave when I'm so close.
When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
I can't do that --
Why don't you come to our house instead?
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
I would.
You wouldn't believe me.
What is it?
David... I appreciate your concern I do.  But I ask you to have faith in me.  Just for a little while longer.  I'm working on something now.  Something... extraordinary.
That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
Alex nothing will ever change what happened but --
Do you find her?
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door save one is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
It wasn't your fault Alex.
You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this or that if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
I know that --
I live with it every minute of every day.
What happened to Emma will never go away.  It's part of you now and it always will be.  But you have to learn to live with it...
I care more about my life.  And yours.
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
Hiding?
But you won't listen.  You won't see me you won't see anyone.  What would you like me to tell Jamie? That Uncle Alex is busy?  That Uncle Alex is hiding up there in his laboratory --
You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
For God's Sake David --
It's my Jamie's birthday today. Your godson.  He's nine years old. At his party he asked me if Uncle Alex was coming.  I told him no. Then he asked me if you didn't like him anymore.
Then why are you here?
It hurt me Alex.  Very much.
I'm sorry David.
I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
I've been working.
Perseverance.
All these clocks -- how can you constantly be running late?!
She's gotten into your equations.
Oh?
Alex really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl and she's done wonderful things for you.
No I'm all bowler hat remember?
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
How romantic...
Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
Nothing.
What?
In the future we'll be better.
But shouldn't it be better? Shouldn't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this?
You may not like it but this is the world we live in Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
Look at them Philby all alike everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?
You sound like my father...
Alex this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
Where's the challenge in that?
You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow so lacking in imagination.  The dim little eyes devoid of curiosity.
God and I'm running late --
Tonight's the night?
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
I was not.
Do you know you were humming?
... The point is I know it will work once the um numbers and such are in order.
All right all right -- here -- everything --
Did you hear me lad?
I don't understand.
And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
Sir...?
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this moved as I am by your protestations of love I'll be needing your money now.
Thank you...
Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
My laboratory was about... here. And the kitchen was over there where that tree is.  Mrs. Watchit wouldn't allow me in much... but yes this is about the kitchen.
It was different then.
Kalen -- we have to get Kalen -- !
Mara -- what -- ?!
No!
Mara...?
Kalen...
Please I beg you.  Take him away from here --
Mara --
Alexander take my son away.  Take him back to your time.  Will you do that?
I could...
Go back to your own time?
Yes... I suppose so.
So you can use it now?
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
It's undamaged?
Good -- it looks fine.  We had quite a ride together...
I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.
You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives.  Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much.  I thank you for that.
If you only knew...
Is it?
Yes... After her death it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
Someone you loved very much.
Yes.
You lost someone.
This is where my journey started... right here.
Over there was Fifth Avenue -- and the Plaza Hotel was there... this is... the carriage path.  We're on the carriage path.
You know this?
Those rocks over there... they're the same... this is... Central Park.
Orion's belt...
Alexander...?
Looking back... I suppose it was. I didn't quite realize it at the time but...
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
Oh it was...  ... Most of the time.
It must have been safe.
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
Did you have fires at night?
Oh very.  Learning commerce the arts -- the whole place was buzzing all the time.  Night and day.
Learning was important?
Oh very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
You liked it there.
... It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.
I try to imagine how they'll look when they're done.  I try to imagine how we'll fit in with them... our place in the world.
How do you decide?
I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
What are you?
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
Or mud carriers.
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
I mean why do you do it?  What purpose does it serve?
I don't understand.
What's it all for?
It's not supposed to be easy it's supposed to be beautiful.
What you need is an engineer.  If you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights some basic block and tackle mechanism you could to this a lot more easily.
Want to be a high climber now do you?
I can see Kalen's point.
The mud carriers.
Yes.
And this is your "work"?
Thank you.
This is magnificent...
We share everything.
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
Every night.
All of you?
We all have that dream.
Yes!
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
Yes.
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
Mara I had a strange dream last night.  I was here walking through a forest very much like this and then...
Good night.
Good night then.
Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights.  I never really noticed them much...
Don't then have stars where you come from?
You can see so many here.
You seem fascinated by the stars.
Thank you...
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
I will...
I'm going to sit with Kalen.  Keep the fire burning if you can.
Just a dream.  You should sleep too.  You're still not well.
Is he all right?
For a time it was astounding.  I saw the years spinning by I was in the years spinning by.  We made such advances.  I don't understand half of them.  There was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky... We must have been incredible thinkers and artists --
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine see that it hasn't been damaged...
I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
Why would you do that?
Why not?
Why?
More than 800000 years.
How long ago?
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
That machine --
I know it's hard to believe but it's true.
Oh that explains everything.
Then you can speak slowly.
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
What makes you say that?
You're not from beyond the valley.
It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
He's gone to a better place.
Your husband is dead?
Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
Mm.
His curiosity is amazing.
Some.  But I mean we aren't all so... handsome.
Is there a lot of illness?
Thank you.
Yes.
Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.
How long did you travel?
Yes...
You're up!  You must be feeling better --
That'll be all.
May I get you some --
All right Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
Tell him to go away --
Yes sir he --
Here?
Sir Mr. Philby is here.
Ouch -- all right wish me luck.
Oh I'm already swooning.
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
Now that's more like it.  You look a proper gentlemen for once.
What's the matter with -- ?  -- What would I do without you Mrs. Watchit?
I have it but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
Hello Mr. Philby.
Do you have it?!
Oh huzzah the master's home.
Very good.  Now if you will excuse us for a moment.
Yes sir.
Because it's a new way of seeing the world!  Of seeing our place in it!
Abstract mathematics relativity of dimensions geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation what is the point?
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
The advances you speak of were the result of countless years of study and empirical experimentation a careful evolutionary process not chalkboard parlor-tricks.
With respect sir would we have the telegraph without fantasy? Would we have radium and X-rays without someone first dreaming we could?
Sir --
Animal husbandry is science Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns social behavior and breeding.  Empirical exacting quantifiable records.
No sir --
No Dr. Hartdegen they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
And roosters.
Do they?
Sir that curriculum is forty years out of date.  The students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times.  They want to explore.
Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
Might I ask why?
Well... perhaps I have "deviated" the tiniest bit.
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
Imagine that.
Well just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
Exactly correct sir.
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering" am I correct?
I see.
Dr. Philby Dr. Hartdegen.  I received the most extraordinary letter last week.  From a parent. We are always pleased to receive letters from parents.  They are our employers after all.  This gentleman's son is in your class Dr. Hartdegen.
We can't change the day and the night Alexander.  This is the world.
You won't even try?
We are what we are.
Then it's time to change that --
This is out life Alexander.  It's a hard life but it is how we have always lived.
My God!  How can you just do nothing!?  They're your friends your family.  You all knew Mara. You ate with her and worked with her... Your work in the valley what is that for if not to --
We choose to believe it.
You know that's not true.
They've gone to a better place.
What do you mean?!
Alexander I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
We have to go after them find where -- !
We don't know.
Where do they take them?!
I suppose so.
Good morning Alexander.  Feeling up to some work?
Of course.  You're just tired. Mara will you look after Alexander tonight?
I'm sorry I didn't mean to...
My father has gone to a better place.
No I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
I am the oldest.
Yes.  I hope you won't take this the wrong way but is there someone older I could talk to?  An elder or patriarch of some kind?
New Yorkers.
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
Why?
Oh very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of um trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
I took a different route.
He said he traveled for two months.
No...
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
New Yorkers.
Well I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
What are your people called?
"Eloi"?
Well we're happy you're here. Come inside.
I did...
And hungry I'd say.  You had such a long journey.
Now you are upsetting my fowl. Please go.
Yes sir.
You supported his application Dr. Philby.  You are his senior advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
If I might explain sir --
Young man we have a way of doing things here.  Radical theorizing is not acceptable.  Have I made myself understood?
Sir if I may --
Dean Fulton...
My fowl have polluted the yard.
Kalen look at me.  There's no one here but us.  You see... I'm here you're here Alexander's here. There are no Morlocks.  It was just a dream...
They're inside --
No you're safe --
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
Kalen it's all right I'm here --
You'll tell me more tomorrow?
Kalen right now you need to go up to bed.  You're exhausting Alexander.
I want to see your home.  Will you take me?
I am.  Are you a climber?
We'll see about that.
What's it like where you come from?
What did you do at night?
That's quite enough Kalen.
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
Kalen...
How did you get hurt?
Goodnight Mr. Philby.
I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight Mrs. Watchit.
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
I'm glad he's gone.  Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.
Sir?
No sir.
And you've no idea where he went?
I don't know what to tell you sir. He's been gone this whole week.
For our sake I hope not.
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
Hello Mrs. Watchit.  You're looking in the pink.
I want to see the sun rise.
What do you want me to do?
Not good.
How does it look?
I don't understand.
It means "bloodbrother."
Pain cuts the deepest isn't that what you said?
You're hurting me.
Well it's in mine too.  I'm a pureblood.  I wasn't turned.  I was born this way.  Just like you.  Am I evil because I want to survive?  What about a wolf?  What about any predator?
I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
Why do you hate us so much?
If that's true then why'd you save me?
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over all bets are off.
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
Why?
You don't want to go there.
I wouldn't read too much into it.
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today but you didn't.
For what?
Thank you.
I don't think so.
Anyone else make it?
"Each day is a little life.  Every waking and rising a little birth every fresh morning a little youth every going to rest and sleep a little death."
What?
Each day is a little life.
Save it.  I don't want to hear your words.  Let's do this NOW!!!
Blade.
Fry 'em.
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
Really?  What are we supposed to do then?  Starve ourselves because we fee on others in order to live?  What about that scumbag you just let off the hook? A nothing.  A drug-dealer.  How do you justify saving people like that?
You don't have to hunt to do it.
He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.
Exactly.  Look at the digestive system. It's been drastically simplified.  Super charged.  And this --
Like cancer with a purpose.
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies creating new parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
Nomak's different.  He's the carrier.  There's something driving him beyond the Thirst.  Something we're missing.
If that's true what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.
Time.
Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
Recognize him?
Minutes.
how long since he was bitten?
I didn't know.
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
What about Nomak?
I'll heal.
You're hurt.
Nothing.
What was that?
We need it.  Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  Tattoos piercings tribal scarring -- because we regenerate none of it's permanent.  So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive.
What is it with you people and pain?
I haven't forgotten.
This is our world you're entering.  You may see things -- feeding.  Just remember why you're here.
The House of Pain.
Where to first?
We're going to be working as a unit you people will be taking orders from me.  So let's get it over with.  I'll give you a free shot Reinhardt.
What the hell are you doing Blade?
You've been training two years to take me out.  Here I am the big bad vampire hunter.  So do it.
No.  They've been training to hunt you.
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
Two years.
You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
Seems like he's doing me a favor then.
Survival.
Why?
They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big bad boogie-man.  Frankly I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily I mean.  Without any assurances.
What?
Blood...
Come on Blade.  Talk to me!
Then who does he work for?
I did some checking on that Carter Stevens character.  That familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the NIH? Turns out he used to work for them but he doesn't anymore.
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
What's your problem Whistler?
Just out connecting a few dots.
Where the hell have you been?
Your security's for shit kid.
We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless quick to anger --  You said it yourself Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
I am worrying.  Seems to me you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
I wouldn't worry about it.
You ask me you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
I'll show you.
Where were you Whistler?
Ran into a little Reaper trouble myself.
I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
I'm not giving you a choice old man.
I don't like it.
He's right.  They'll smell that you're human.  Stay here watch our backs.
These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain.  They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.
What do you really think?
Sounds like a plan.
What do you think?
Either that or feeding the worms.
I agree.  We play along for now we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks.
You put a bullet in my brain.  Wouldn't expect anything else.
Let's just hope you've kicked the Thirst for good.  I'll be watching you close. You start to back-slide --
Took you long enough.
Did you think I wouldn't?
You came back for me.
Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.
How do you feel?
Seems like there's a lot of that going around these days.
Thought you were dead.
Put it back in park Blade.
So I think you people may have underestimated how many Reapers you're dealing with.
So?
Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.
Spare me the race card OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
Look I care about the humans who are dying not you got it?
And so will we.
Revenge.  That's what Nomak wanted all along.  To pay back the people who created him.
And why is that?
Too bad you're out of it.
True but thanks to you we know his weakness.  We can keep him contained. It's just a matter of time before we hunt him down.
I should think that would be obvious at this point.
The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?
Not alone.
You want me to hunt them for you.
For what?
It has been said you may have enemies whom you hate but not enemies whom you despise.  Be proud of your enemy: then his success shall be yours too.  In that regard I should thank you.
Two things.  One I was on to you the moment they turned you.  And two --  I switched that dud of yours back with the real one.
So that's down and dirty.  Got anything to say for yourself?
You're wasting your time Blade.  The flechette's a dud.
Kiss your ass goodbye Reinhardt.
He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
Nomak?
He was here.  Watching us.
What's going on?
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
So you're going to do this?
Human?
Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
I don't know about this man --
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.
You got something in mind Blade?
Ain't nobody here but you and me chicken wing.  I'd say this is as good a time as any to settle up.
What the fuck you doing?
Yeah but you fangs can see in the dark. What am I supposed to do?
We want to attract them not scare them off.
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing buttercup.
Listen hillbilly you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.
You need to ratchet those 'nads of yours down a few notches paco.
Oh yeah?  Like how little?  In case you hadn't noticed we lost two men while you were out farting around.
Well you've got it warmblood.  Now what the fuck are you gonna do with it?
Getting your attention Paco.
Hey hey!  The fuck you doing?!
Maybe it's better that way.
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
We're locked in.
You experimented on your own son?
From his father of course.
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?
Thiavolos as we used to say in Greece. The Devil.  Pure Thirst.  Nothing more. He was born a vampire but he is an anomaly.  Like you.  Unlike the rest of us however he feeds on not just humans but vampires as well.
His name is Jared Nomak.
As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
You worry too much Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
Any game worthy of being played is.  One must be patient.  In this way I have outlived my enemies.  All of them.
No.  This is a dangerous game you're playing Damaskinos.
An inevitability I suppose.  Nyssa was not among them I trust.
Two so far.
Any casualties?
They've made contact with the Reapers.
Yes?
Us?  What are you talking about?
Your blood has a very rare phenotype one that's quite valuable to people like us.
It depends.  We came up with some unusual results on your blood test.
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
Not that I'm in contact with.
I see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
Back when Blade had me hunting down your puckered old ass.  What's up with your hair anyway?  Fucking Willie Nelson look-a-like?
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
Yeah your little cootchie knew.
After last night?  Dude I'm a lover not a fighter.
What about you?  You're not coming?
I was backpacking.  Hooked up with these two chicks who were off to see the Burning Man festival.  We were gonna take "E" have ourselves a little freeball out in the desert.  You know the riff "Dear Penthouse I never thought this would happen to me but --"
Pretty.
Blade doesn't talk about anything much.  What about you though?
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
Going on twenty years now.
So how long have you known Blade anyway?
Nope.  Back then we did not.
Yeah but you didn't have the Scudster working on it did you?
You're wasting your time already been tried.
Tweaked the phosphor rod modified the collimated beam wanna concentrate the light get something like a UV laser going.
The hell are you fiddling with there?
Look kid they obviously found your base of operations.  If it was a trap why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?
This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.
Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation you fucking turd stain.
Hey you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
Look what's your problem?
Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?
And you'll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change.
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft higher flowing fuel pump.
Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
Scud.
Tell me something Skid --
I can't call it off.  He's not responding.  Get out of my way.
You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
I'm going to Paris.
We're in the shitter man!  Pick your poison.  Maybe he's in there to finish the job.  Maybe he's working for Wombosi.  Maybe they want to go on TV together.  Every possibility sucks -- we've got to move!
We don't know what we're into!
What do you want to do?
Forget it.
-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
-- if we can get a clean shot --
-- he went inside! --
This doesn't go upstairs.
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
No.  We can't risk it.
Turn?  To who?  Where does he turn? What does he have to offer?  He's got nothing.  He's a killer.  He's a piece of equipment for crissake. Where's he gonna turn?
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
That was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  He's loose.  He's out of control.  It's very clear what needs to happen.  I have work to do.
I'm not asking.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
I want a second opinion.
We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been <u>sleeping</u> down here.  We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  I'd rethink that.
Yes well I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
We're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  We are in pursuit.  How much more do you want me to tell you?
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover it's a great one.
Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.
And what if I couldn't do that?
You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
They're putting together an agency oversight committee.  They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  What am I going to do about that?
I thought you were never going to do that.
Yes.
You're asking me a direct question?
We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
I don't know what we're talking about.
Storm clouds are gathering Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.
Why?
...they won't let you go...
What do they want me to do?
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
I think so.
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
What is Treadstone?
...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills right?  Treadstone had those pills...
Treadstone.
...it's a problem...
Yes.
...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
Paris.  I live in Paris...
...which one are you?...
Treadstone?
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
What do you mean?
I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
I won't ask again.
That'll be their second worst mistake.
Jason...  They can't let you go...
Keep it. 
<u>There never was a Jason Bourne</u>.  You have to come with me.  It's the only way.  We can give it back to you...
Jason Bourne is dead.
We have to go home Jason.
I don't think so.
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
That's all I get?
So it's time to go home.
So now you know.
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
I know you've been trying to kill me.
They're right about you aren't they?  You're fried.  You really don't know what's going on do you?
I don't know.
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing Jason?
<u>What did you do to me</u>?
Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?
Are you Treadstone?
Get the kids out!
I don't know.
<u>Was this a game or a fuck up</u>?
I know who sent you.  I don't know why.  I learned many many things from the CIA.  <u>Many</u> things.  I learned the way they think.  Was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?
Who do you think sent me?
It's a lot more stressful than I thought.
I think investment advice from a dead man it's a bad idea.  How does it feel to be dead?
MPG Capital.
Did you bring investment advice for me tonight?  It was tax shelters wasn't it?  Swiss debenture-swaps.
Yeah I know...
Sir you waited on line.
Look maybe I should just...
<u>Do you have your passport sir</u>?
I have a passport.  I've got...  Actually it's a little complicated.
You have your passport?
Right.
Well either you are or you aren't.
Yes.  I mean I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
You're a U.S. Citizen?
One moment sir.
Kane.  Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane?
-- hang on -- I need you to check another name for me -- hang on -- un moment s'il vous plait --
-- sir? --
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
One moment please...  I'm afraid I have no one by that name registered sir.
Yes I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
Yes sir...  How can I help you?
Paris?

...yes -- oui -- uh...
I think not...  No I'm sorry.  It was very sudden. He was here very briefly.
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
Right.  Yes.  Of course.
His brother.  You know his brother?
Who?  Who came?
...we actually we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things it was made known for us you see?
...I understand...
There was an accident.  On the motorway.  Apparently he was killed instantly.  Really I'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this...
I have some very bad news for you sir.  I'm terrible sorry to have to tell you this but Monsieur Kane has passed away almost two weeks ago...
Yes.
You are a friend of his?
Yes.  Is he there?
You call about Monsieur Kane?  John Michael Kane?
Yes I'm here...
Bonjour?  Monsieur?  Allo...
That'd be great.
Let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
I hadn't heard.
We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
Excuse me?
Was it the break-in?
Okay.
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job as I said a bit more competitive.
Yes.
Look our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you we did some re-analysis of the numbers and honestly we'd really like a chance to do a bit better.  I'm assuming you're still in the market.  It's the same vessel?
Well I mean it's a tough business isn't it?  Cutthroat.
Did you?
We thought you were gone for good.
Really.
Well...  I must admit when my assistant told me you were here I was really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
Thanks.
Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.
Not really.
You have ID?
Think I could rent a scooter?
Yes.
This your store?
Can I help you?
I'm gonna find the end of this.  I can't protect you.
What about you?
I can't protect you anymore.
What was I thinking right?
If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  <u>Take it</u>.
And that's it?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
We have to keep moving.
Who is it?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
I won't let that happen.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
What?
Stop where you are.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx.
Yes.  That's who I want to be.
You could do that?
It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now I don't know maybe I have more maybe it's nothing but...  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.
Go back to the hotel.
<u>So what are we doing</u>?
I don't know. 
What does that mean?  Jason what does that mean?  Jason please...who is he?
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. 
What is that?
Nykwana Wombosi. 
-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.
I found it.  It took six calls.  I found Kane.  I found the body.
It's a company... MPG Capital.
Who paid the bill?
You stayed there five times in the past six months.  But I didn't have time -- I could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  Some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
I don't know what happened!  I don't know who he is!  I don't know what he wants!  I don't even know who I am!  The only thing I know is that if I stay here I'm never gonna find out!
-- we'll tell them what happened --
-- forget it --
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
-- how? --
-- we'll explain it --
-- there's no time --
But the police --
You stay -- if you want you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
Oh Jesus...
And where is he now?  You believe what you want but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
I didn't know this would happen.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
I trusted you.
No.
You knew he was coming.
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
He came to kill us.
-- we can't stay here -- I can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
He's dead isn't he?
-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my God -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
-- let me do this okay? --
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
Marie just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
-- just --
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
What? -- what? --  -- what is it?
...omigod no...
WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
-- what're you doing? -- Jason please tell me what's happening!
-- quiet -- <u>quiet</u> --
-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
-- no -- Marie -- <u>no</u>! -- it's not like that --
Go ahead.
See.  It's starting to come back yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
This is your office?  God you live like a monk...
I guess so.
This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours?
How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
Nah...  With you I mean you'd probably just forget about me right?
Look you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
You got me pretty fucking curious.
Look I don't know what's up there.
Anytime.
Thanks for the ride.
Okay so...
Jason...
I don't remember any of this.
I should go.
I guess.
So this is it right?
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
Where?
No.  No.  Go around.  Keep going...
Looks familiar?
Four-fifty.  That's the address...
That's it?  Is that it?
Slow down.  No don't stop.  Just...
I thought about it.  I don't know.
You ever think maybe you have a family?
I dream I'm asleep.  I dream that I'm asleep and I can't wake up.  I don't think I smoke.
You were tired.  Here...  For twenty-thousand I like to throw in breakfast.  So what do you dream about?
I can't believe I slept.
We're about an hour away.
Where are we?
I needed a break.
You're paranoid.  You were shot. It's natural.
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
People do amazing things when they're scared.
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
Okay so you're a victim.
I was shot twice in the back.
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
I don't know.
What are you talking about?
-- which was okay for a while I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
-- you could put it together --
I kept trying things I thought if I could find all the things I could do I could --
Well this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
Nothing.  It's just not there.
When you think of it before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship what do you see?
No.
And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?

That's what I'm saying.
Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
Look go ahead...put the radio on...
What?  Like amnesia?
No.  No I mean I really don't know who I am.  I can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I'm serious.
Yeah well welcome to the club.
I don't know.  I don't know who I am.
Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?
Listen to what you want.
What does that mean?
I don't know.
I don't know.  Smile.  Sneeze. Something.  You've got a bag full of money and a ride to Paris.  Fuck it I don't know...  What kind of music do you like?
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
I know that.
Just so you know if you're gonna burn me on the money you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.
Then I'll find another ride.
What if I say no?
I won't hurt you.
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
I don't want anything but a ride. All I want to do is go home.
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
Look I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.
-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money this crazy offer I mean give me a fucking break with this this is -- 
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
<u>No</u>.  No that was too easy -- 
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
You have blood on your pants.
I said ten thousand.
For twenty thousand dollars.
I want to go home.
So what's in Paris?
Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.
Jesus...
You don't want the police any more than I do.
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
Get the fuck away from my car.
I've got a situation here and --
It's a little late for that.
Please.  I don't want to scare you.
Oh Jesus... 
I need a ride out of here.

I need a ride.
-- here we go -- I found it --
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
-- we have rules here this is a very serious place -- I'm the one who decides who gets in here okay? --
-- don't sweat it I have a pen -- no problem -- just let me find the page --  -- honey why don't you wait for me outside okay? --
-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
Is this it? --  -- this is it right? --
Fine.  But I'd like to sign in.  In fact I insist on it.  Where's the book?  I gotta sign in -- 
So get the hell out of here.
Shit we didn't sign in.
I said someone came last night --  Look this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
Where did this body go?
I'm sorry.
Wait a minute --
You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
What the hell're you talking about?
Get everyone down in the basement.
What?
Get in the basement.
That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something right?
He run away often?
My husband's out looking for him.
Where's the dog?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx...
So now you're asking for a student visa?
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
-- Miss Kreutz please --
-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
You only know that because I told you!  Ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- I told him all this myself! -- 
<u>Miss Kreutz</u> excuse me but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the United States --
All the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- I brought all the papers --
Miss Kreutz please... I'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.
-- I want that red car -- the girl -- we gotta get lucky here --
-- I'm on it --
-- let's check that Interpol window again --
Enhance it.
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
What's that?
Sir...
Hang on... 
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
That's the only angle.
And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
That'll solve all our problems.
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
What?
All of them?
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
What the fuck is he doing?
Zurich police are looking for an American with a red bag.  Apparently he put two cops in the hospital last night.
What?
-- yes sir it's confirmed --
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
-- he accessed the account --
-- and they're sure it's him? --
I tried.
Tell him we're busy.
Abbott wants to talk.
What?
-- he's running from the cops he's got a bag filled with God knows what he's in the building and I don't know where! --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- what're you talking about? --
I won't forget this.
It's not much but it should get you to Switzerland.
I don't know.
You drink rum?
I don't remember Zurich.
Look I'm just on this boat okay? I'm an engineer.  Whatever this is it's not for me to be involved okay?
No.
It came from your hip.  Under the skin.  You have a bank in Zurich.  You remember Zurich?
I told you.  You need to rest.
What if it doesn't come back?
You we're lost at sea.  They pulled you out.  Who are you?  You were shot -- two bullets -- in the back.  You understand me?  Who are you?
How did I get here?
You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor but the wounds it looks okay.  It's clean.
<u>Where am I</u>?
You're American.  I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
Where am I?
You're awake.  Can you hear me?  You've been shot.  I'm trying to help you.  You were in the water.  You've been shot.  It's okay now.
Adonis be polite. She's a friend.
Yew'll be ovah in the naxt tehn minutes...
I'm not going to worry about it. We are quite beyond the computer disc. Everything will be over within the next hour or so.
I don't know about you guys but I'm getting a little buzz off this.
Works for me.
Ayy!  Some cat's blocking the periscope.  Somebody give it a swat...
Have we reached the epi-center?
It's okay. Let her go.
Oh Man not the sewer I just had this cape cleaned...
You have to dial nine first.
I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
Do I have to remind everyone that in two days we'll all be dead. The Cult of Good will be a memory. I don't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals. We have a secret mission...
Crowd always buys it. What do we got?
The crowd bought it.
Sorry sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God Captain God I shall not fail you..
Hey Hot Stuff. You're still on the clock...
Yeah all those women who went feline this afternoon...They're so ashamed now..
You know nobody likes you...
That's a good one dude. He says we're going to kill you whether you tell us where the disc is or not.

Be verwy verwy quiet; I'm hunting Catwomen.
Ah Cats. Now and Forever.
This looks promising...
I thought we were going to take it easy until the Mission...
Oops--my face must match my cape. And to think we were going to let you go...
Cactus I can't believe you just said all that...
I lied.
I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.
We'll hunt him down together...
In many ways that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
You're serious?  You'd help me...
It would be honor Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
Somewhere very far away very quiet and very...  This is all wonderful Selina but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster..
Oh now you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?
A couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together.  Thank you Jeff.
Quite a pair we make. Thank you Jeff.
I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman..
No-o. You know questions like that don't help your cause--
You're telling the truth. I can tell..How did this..
Hmm. Not bad.
What did you say?  Selina sit down the entire city is going crazy...You have to just calm down...
Tonight somewhere in the city innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God.
Uh Brock today you are without me...
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
Selina did you make it home all right?  I tried calling but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..
I'm sure.
Are you sure?
Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
This is insane. Let the heroes handle it.  I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
Well it's just that I would think that the woman who is the real non- imitation Catwoman would be pretty angry at some little amateur minx stealing the whole whip idea. Really angry.
What's the matter?  What are you saying?
A whip?  Now that's going too far!  Some of these women have no shame!
No it's not.
What little boy doesn't...  My God...it's it's...Catwoman.
I'm sorry I went off like that I get passionate. I--I guess I'm a passionate person. One of those things I had forgotten.  When you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero?
So did you see "Seinfeld" last week? That Kramer-guy really makes me laugh.
Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh he has a secret side.  Ooh she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.
I despise these kind of winds. Sorry I guess I'm a little on edge. Seems this Catwoman has everyone men and women on edge. Don't you feel Catwoman says something about the duality of all men and women...
You're very special. Selina I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I again?
Hey hey the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
Oh it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
What did you think?
You designed Gotham Plaza?  The big silver guys pulling on those big silver things...
I'm not afraid. Are you?
There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion if..
But of course you are. Dinner at Eight.  Wouldn't miss it.
Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way I'm Brock Leviathan.
How heroic of you...
I was wondering if you're not doing anything tonight...Would you like to go to dinner? I know; a tame suggestion considering the wide variety of miniature golf possibilities available to the Oasisburg citizen--but nevertheless would you?
You're probably right.
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
Nothing just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
What's the matter...
I wonder..
Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..
I don't know. I can't remember.
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
Guilty. I am.
You say that like an amnesia victim.
I'll bet. Funny for some reason I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
No in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
In women?
He likes you. Kincaid and I have always had similar tastes...
What little boy doesn't?
I guess we did. When you were a little boy did you want to be a superhero?
But then we knew that all along didn't we...
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
I've been looking for you.
It may be time to get the police involved...
I can. That's not an admission of guilt  It's just..I knew you had it in you...
Did you ever think that maybe neither of us is Captain God?
Quiet Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning Selina I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God or whatever else he may be calling himself this month but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
We're waiting.
Your uniform that first time I saw you was a ghastly cage I vowed to unlock in order to..
You're right I wasn't looking to fall in love with a casino worker. I'd given up trying to find anyone. But there was a fire in your eyes that cut right through the air conditioning and through the coldness of my heart.
But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
You're kidding.
Yes did you call us here for any particular reason?
Selina are you okay?
Oh you don't have to explain to me where you're going...
I better go report this in...
I suppose she does.
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
A bit on the suspicious side don't you think?
She has a real spirit.
Selina Kyle...lovely person.
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
Women huh?
Can I just say what a classy touch the neon urinals are Mr. Architect?  I just love risking electrocution every time I..
Oh how long have you had your own route?
There you are darling...Have we met Lewis Lane Oasisburg Times.
Oh come on Cactus be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule right?
Catwomen. Lots of them!
Wha-at?
God can you hear me!
Just hold on!  I'm not done. There are two kinds of men in the world Selina. In Category A you have Me. In Category B is everyone who wants to be in Category A but are too afraid too weak..!
Boss we better roll if we're going to hit this place blow it up and make that flight..
Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything?  Blink once for yes twice for..
Priceless...We have a showdown in this alley right?
Hey speaking of Wrong Place Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes.
What about "climbing in?"
The "skylight?" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
Even the skylight?
Don't you realize there's nothing you can do anyway!  Nine minutes and it's all over!  The Fun Palace is a tomb. No one can get out. And choke on this furball: all doors and windows are blocked locked and electrified!  Even the glass around the bomb is rigged.
Well then let's agree to disagree...Now how about a picture for my scrapbook?
You might be right but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
Will you please stop fighting?  Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together!  Trust me one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit it's a lot more fun to be the villain.
I know I know a Warrior. You're very annoying..Now tell me how to defuse the bomb you've set..
You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect I'm a..
Pass!
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day and by night we'll dress up and kill anything that...
Oh Honey it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
My dog!
At this point a nap. Oh by the way I killed your butler and your dog..
What do you want from me?
Winning.
I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives not thirty one!  What do you think you're doing?
Touchy. Look everybody it's Casper the friendly crimefighter...
Cactus sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
Yeah this is better than rape.
Resting Up?  Sorry Spooky I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.  Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win.
Not now Mammoth. Adonis is right. We've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates the merchandising scams-- Tomorrow night we have a big violent complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. We chould be resting up.
Ooh I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham...
What's the catch?
He didn't remember to roll up his window...
"Dat's gotta hurt!"
I hate innocent bystanders.  Whine whine whine. Will he settle?
The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store..
I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
My the Perpetrator seems to be a bit on the "Wild" side..
Absolutely.
Car wash Captain?
I got her...
Quite a little performance you gave in the casino today--for me and that other guy. Come on down let's chat..
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry we've got work to do.
Ah did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
I know how you feel humiliated in the hands of a woman. I'd rather eat my soul on a paper plate...
Sorry man I didn't mean that personally...
What did you say?
God-damn..
How could I forget. Mammoth--go pet the kitty.
I don't know Boss you saw what the big guy did to the last kitty we gave him.
Why am I still troubled...
Right time. That was kind of fun. She had spunk.
I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
Boss-man what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
Well. I stand corrected.
That is not a man Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble.
I know.
I loved you.
Of course it matters!  It throws off everything!  "Superhero" is manhood's highest achievement. Manhood!  Your dirty little secret has diseased us to the core. You were my buddy my comrade-- women aren't buddies women aren't warriors!  You tried to turn the Cult of Good into some after-work softball team!  It's time to get thrown from the treehouse...
Why are you--I fought for you with honor.  Why should it matter if I'm a man or a woman as long as I'm a good warrior.
Just like a woman. You want out. You're out.
I want out of tonight's mission. I can't do it anymore Captain. I can't let innocent people die to prove our superiority..I can't.
What's the matter with you Spooky my most trusted comrade?  We are warriors!  These are the challenges we live for!
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark-- Ladies Night at a discotheque.  It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?
Oh I like her. I like her a lot. I want to save this one for later. Something that tasty you don't eat all at once. Go back to your alter- egos we'll regroup in the morning.
You like them don't you Boss.
Just a homeless woman. Wrong place.
Well you don't see that everyday. Somebody tell me what's the deal with Frida Kahlo here?
A bit sadistic don't you think Captain...?
Well we spent enough time building the damn thing might as well use it.
Now he'll be up all night...
Oh I wish they wouldn't feed him like that.
You can't get away with..
Ah the good guys always triumph in the end. It's what allows our children to sleep at night.
Do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid?  Zilcho. Urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. Not exactly the stuff of a W-2 form.  If it wasn't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical "missions"...There is no such thing as heroes and villains anymore Selina.  There are only winners and losers. You lost. We won.
I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  You people were once heroes. You had ideals.  You fought for things.  Spooky told me so...
I know I should probably tell you but I just don't feel like it. To be honest I'm really angry at you. I admired you so much more when you were purely wicked. I mean look at you now running around trying to "get to the bottom" of things. Trying to "save the city." It's true we're about to do a very nasty deed but really what's it to you?  Since when do you care what happens to a bunch of pathetic Oasiburgians? You're just not yourself anymore.
How can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and...Who are you?  Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table?  Tell me!  Please tell me who you are; you own me that!
You've seen me...
You think so?...Selina?
I still have one left...
Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
Oh please sir one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
My those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible corrupt joke.
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil don't you?
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
And...your point?
You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary sick fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me..
Hello Rachel. I'm Selina.
You know my name's not Spooky. It's it's Rachel.
"Save the City?" I don't want to save the city I want to move!  Listen I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie but..
The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
Oh no not a computer disc. A computer disc?  Oh man come on what do I look like?  I'm not a crime- fighter I'm not a detective what I'm supposed to find some "clues" on this disc. I can't...
And I...I..want you to know our secrets..
For when the..Uh yeah thanks a little gold piece of...gold. Uh...
For when the time comes..
Men huh?
I heard what you said Spooky. I can't believe he shot you...
You're not strong. You're scared..scared that someone like me will see right through you. Whatever the Cult of Good was it's not anymore... You don't have to listen to me just listen to you..
Can't you understand--I got tired of being a woman. I wanted the respect that only a cape boots chestplate and a mechanical spear can bring..
Whatever you say...Sis.
I don't want to hurt you Catwoman. Yet.  After tomorrow you can do anything you want but please just stay out of sight for the next 24 hours. I won't stand by and watch my leader get all emotional over an animal like you. I warn you don't tempt Captain God when he is angry. Let is complete our mission in peace.
Hello Spooky.
Spear.
Spooky.
Ask me another one--
What's the name of your child's best friend?
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
You mean "Consuela" is a good mother..
I'm a good mother!
Did you just say "girls?"
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
You Housewives have no idea what we go through!
Kelly get to work on those new uniforms.  I'm not running a summer camp here..
What if I were to say "Your Wife"-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel?
What if I were to say "You're Fired?"
Oh Frank I'm not anti-male I'm anti- you. Believe me there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees look into it.
Hey you're anti-male.
Can I be frank Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.
Oh what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
Stop.
There you are Selina. I've been thinking..I have some.."positions" opening up..
Yeah as in born before..Ooh I suppose it's "sexual harassment" to give a woman a compliment. Sheesh. Come on gentleman...
"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
You know Kyle you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...
What's the good news?
You're late. I've got some good news and some good news. I'm giving you more hours and the new uniforms came in.
I'll let you know.
We have to do something. What can we do to help Selina?
Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens.
Okay. Let's get serious. Of course I know the Cult of Good is not good. Ever since I saw what they did in Atlanta it has been my mission to expose them. I've followed them to Oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice. That computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle. This isn't just a story Selina--another damn Pulitzer--this is my life.
You know now that I hear myself tell it I'm thinking maybe both of you are messing with me. What you get the Helmet Monday through Thursday then Brock takes it for the weekend...
Then there's you Louis sneaking through back alleys and surprise visiting me at my home..Both of you have been way too frisky from the get- go. I'm actually a pretty amazing person--funny smart attractive when I get my sleep--but you two had no way of knowing that-- when I met you both I was basically a morose depressed amnesiac incapable of any human feeling. The only reason one of you wanted to go out with me is because you knew I was Catwoman.
Not too cool...
Lose the smile Mr. Good Reflexes. We were having a pretty okay time the other night--good food good conversation--some Catwomen show up and it's "You need cab fare?; I got to go to my Hideout--Oh I'm sorry I mean "warehouse."
Fine fine at a later date I'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who's not the creep. But for now I'm drilling inside your brains...I bring up the whole Catwoman thing for one reason.  I bit Captain God in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses--  "My grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.."
Some reporter I am..all this time my story is right there in front..I have a lot of questions.
I'm not through. This will come as a shock. Again to one of you. I am Catwoman. The Catwoman.
Hey architect--she's joking. Right Selina?  Selina?
Uh-huh..
You are...
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
You're scaring me Selina.  Do it some more.
Go together?  Sure why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey lean over let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice "A superhero's job is to protect..."
I'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city's tourists. The Mayor in his finite wisdom is throwing a "Month of the Woman" luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down. I thought maybe you and I could...
Hey I thought...
I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying intentionally on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan architect."  I can't believe he ordered white wine.  You do know white wine is not real wine...
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
Like you don't know...
About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay I can't stand it anymore I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
Nothing. How's your hand?
What?
Did you try to kill...
Actually yes.
Oh do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
Yes you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...
You turned around!
What did--?
Hey Captain God!
I thought you'd like a ride to work.  You don't own a cat do you?
Next time call...
Well. I'd let you come in but the place is a mess...
No of course not. You're listed. Not the hut exactly but the rest of..
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
Good morning.
Ah!  Ah!--God no don't tell me you're one of those women who are attracted to ruggedly handsome and brilliant architects..
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
I was wondering if you're not doing anything tonight...
But of course you are.
Oh the hand--my grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender and..You know I realize I've never officially introduced myself...I'm Lewis Lane.
Oh now this one is mine...
Enough.
How much?
I actually got some memory back last night.
Sorry I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
Most articles focus on the first half of her name--describing some feline monster.  I want the woman of Catwoman. After all if it was a man dressed as a cat the story would be on page 23--just another loony. Oh I want this one. I want her bad..
Yeah she's okay.
What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just I like her a lot.
I don't know what came over me.
Uh. "Thanks?"
A genuine woman of mystery in Oasisburg.  Amnesia. Bulletholes in exposed stomach badly concealed with body make-up.  Beautiful intelligent eyes that have no business in "Frank's Fun Palace" or anybody else's Fun Palace for that matter..
"I'll go out with you." Now go get me these old newspapers...
Okay deal.
What if I say I'll go out with you so you can have all these great daydreams but then never actually talk to you again?
It's seeing-eye dogs ma'am. If I let the cat stay will you go out with me?
But I'm blind.
I'm sorry ma'am there are no pets allowed in the library...
Trust me you won't have to.
I don't know if I can do it alone.
Do you always listen to what your mother says?  Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you.  Save the day..
But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times.
Yes you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
Mom not now!  I I don't know what to do..
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
They're going to attack Frank's Fun Palace!
Yes I'm pretty amazing. You should see this...It came this evening.
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
Mom?  Oh Mom I messed up...
It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
Because she asked me--and I couldn't very well turn her down. Don't you remember-- of course you don't remember--that "Hag" is the one who brought you to that hospital in Gotham City. For what it's worth-- currently not much--we owe her your life...When I think about a single woman in Gotham City--amnesia is probably the best thing that could happen to a girl like you...Oh don't forget your visor.
Uh it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
Don't sneak up on me...
Oh so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
I'll take your abuse but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
Pretty good...Mom I don't want you to think I don't appreciate...letting me stay getting me the job--I've been a mess. I'm still a mess. It's just...we have to start having a different conversation. I can't take..
It's funny I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
Maybe.
Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
Oh Mommy you're embarrassing me.
Oh I forgot to tell you you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
A hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning...
Yes Mother. Dear.
You're late.
Thanks.
Nice breasts.
You going to talk all day?
You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane...
The kicks..the rush..you mean like pulling heists..faking your own deaths..killing innocent bystanders...like Mexican angels.  I know you're a woman. Do you?
I'm not sad no I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while you don't care what's a crime and what's not what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
You seem sad Spooky.
We met on the Internet. The Captain put out a cryptic message calling for a new order of crimefighters. We don't even know each other's true identities...
What's it like being a superhero?  It must be frightfully exciting..How did you guys all get together?
Oh pooh come now. If you turn me down I just might throw a fit..you know how us girls can be..
I'm sorry Miss one of us needs to keep surveillance...
What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for?  Dance with me?
I would appreciate a little space. Thank you.
I don't see anybody in there but you.
I know.  But it's an emergency. Somebody dying.  Okay?
This is one way.
Any place.
Where do you think you're going?
Hey Buddy!  Can you let me pull over?  Give me some space to pull over.
I won't let him.  He belongs to me now.  Bye sweetie.
I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
He ran out on me to be with you? Well fuck him!  Everything worked twice as good without him.  We didn't need him then and I don't need him now.
Taking messages.
What are you doing on Theo's line?
Matter of fact I did have a kid once.  But he's a lot better off with his father in Milwaukee.
Don't you have children?
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
Do I hear a woman's voice?
Was someone in an accident?
Any trouble we whip out our Treasury Department badges -- show them the wire I'm wearing and read them their rights.  Theo seizes the Krugerands as evidence. Naturally they start negotiating. Offer to give us up somebody else. And we listen.  Take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at Justice.  We pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing.
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
What if they do question the authenticity?
Wake up.  Make a right at Ocean Avenue.  The hotel's a few blocks up on the left.
This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
Have you got to tell her your life story?
That's all we need.  Better let me drive.
Be careful.  There were people in that crosswalk.
I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.
You gotta just look the other way.
Then whose is it?
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
Look -- I've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line.
He's right Theo.  She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.
This Mercedes of yours what's it look like?
Will you two cut it out?
Did you have to tell her my name?
Theo wants to talk again.
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
I know where it is.  Give me that phone back.
How was I in the wrong?
He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
Me he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
Say something ...
You couldn't hurt me.  But it's the principle.
I didn't hurt you.
So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
You could've made me lose my call.
What was that for?
I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
Who's on the phone?
I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
You could've killed us.
Are you guys all right?
I want the gun emptied.  I want to see all six slugs tossed up here. And then I want out.  That's all. <u>OUT</u>!
I told you I should've cuffed him.
I'm the one they'd be looking for.
Which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law.  These are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.
Mind letting me make the best of a rotten situation?
Can you make him stop!
Yeah I suppose getting whacked has got to be one of your best ways to die.  Particularly if you're not expecting it.  You don't know what hit you.
Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.
How do we get back to the freeway?
Any time you decide to let me in on it.
You missed.
Only I was sloppy.  I let you take me out.  That was quite a humiliation.
Or relieve me of it later.
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
Yes sir.
Nels reporting in.  Sit down where you are.  Arms folded.
You almost brain me and lock me in a fucking trunk and you're on my side?  You stupid fuck!
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
Lady don't let him do it!
See for yourself federal agent U.S. Treasury.  On the job.
What's this?
I'm going to level with you officer.
Let's have your license mister.
Why would I do that?
What'd you do?  Tail me from Brentwood?
They'll wait.  Meantime raise the lid.
I got to get going.  An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
Now that'd be a misdemeanor.
I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.
You never miss a trick.
Put those away.  We can't have marks on his wrists.
Now turn around.  I'm going to cuff you.
So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed.  A thing of beauty. Jesus the shit you come up with!
I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location.  Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies.
You can tell she was really worried about me.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
What else did you expect him to say?  Do it Theo -- or give me the gun.
Look I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
He's seen both of us now.
Sure -- and they record your voice.  And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out!
Okay okay Lenore calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet the F.B.I.
What do you keep making me out to be?
In any event whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
Satisfied Wiseass?
Got your badge?
It's rolled up in the tube on the floor back there.
Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
I improved on the fucking original.
First off this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
<u>You're</u> doing all the talk.
That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
Make a "U" and go back.
And stop with the directions.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
If you know that just back off.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
I don't like anybody laying their hands on me.
That's what I deserve for listening in the first place.
Just hand up on the bitch!  Fuck you madam.  And goodbye!
Will you relax?  This in no way affects our business.  Go on.
What do you mean tip the cops?  Is the man a lunatic or what?
Wait!  I hear her breathing now. There she just picked it up again.
That's your "rep."
Bullshit.
That was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked.  I heard you were a hitter.
Not this minute.
We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation.  So let's go over this again step by step.
It's taken care of.
You switched license plates?
Give me 20 minutes at least.
We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
I was worried about you.  Both of you.
Any minute.
I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
Nels?
There's a taxi stand here.  I can meet you.
He took it like a man.  Toss him in that drainage ditch.
Allow me.
Don't fuck around.  Pop a cap in him.
We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
Lose the hardware now.
What am I supposed to do?
Nels don't let that cop pass you.
I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
I thought you said you could handle him.
I told you ... sooner or later you'd have to trust me ...
Sure like I'm gonna take advice from you.
My fence in San Francisco ... 305-4410.  Maurice.  Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.
I don't want it.
I've got ... one last number for you Theo ...
-- The phones Theo.  Don't leave any of them behind.  The cops could pull up a record of all our calls and -- find you.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.
Five ... six.
Pull over!  Pull over someplace.
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
You won't live to see it.
Think about what's going to happen to your valuables when that trunk flies open at 75 miles per?
Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
Know what else is in here?
Local lawyer for Dominican dealers.  Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
Took preparation.
Some nice fantasy you all cooked up for me.
That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.
Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again.  No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you.
Nothing but CDs in there.  I thought maybe you'd like some Celine or Whitney.
Both hands on your lap.
He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
I'm handling it.
That's how it's going to be.
That's not good enough.
I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
Only one way to find out.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
Naturally.
Naturally.
You're the man with the gun.
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
What's your point?
He might've heard everything we said in the car.
That's a reasonable possibility.
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
What's really on your wicked little mind?
How about "later?"
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
Yeah I was waiting for that suggestion.
We had a backup plan.  But I knew you'd come through for me.
You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
Who'd ever think to look at you?
I need a break.  I've been on a marathon run ever since I had the misfortune to strike up a conversation with you.
Why are we stopping?
Developer ran out of money years back.  I'd hate to think about what's living in there.
Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
There was <u>no</u> cop involved.  Oh shit!  Fuck!
I thought it was inspired.
And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
You timed that beautifully.
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
At least one.
The video cameras will put you with him in the bank and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
Damned if I know.
Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
The guy with the transplant.
It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?
Whose money is this?
There isn't any such person.
You're not Lenore Oberfeld.
The rest of the money is here in the car.  Why don't you come and get it?
Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
He had a gun.  I have it now.
Hand me the phone.
For Christ sakes don't point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.
Somehow I got along better with you on the phone.  It's all there isn't it?
They put their hands all over me.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.
You're going to let them get away with this?
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
Why didn't you just shoot them?
Now I have -- it's a long story.
Include me in that.
She'll never be the same.  None of us will.
She'll be with you soon.  They're pulling up.  They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.
Rachel was terrified when I left her.  I could see it in her eyes.
Shit.  I'm sorry.
It's locked.
Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.
Rachel -- Oh my God.
I'm sorry.  You've thought this out better than I ever could.  I'm ready now.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
Why can't it be her?
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
Yes.  But I want Rachel to come with me.
Can you walk?
Yes.
Don't start thinking about it.  Is the tape off?
I can't do it.
She's next.  In two or three more minutes she'll be free.
I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions.  We're almost there.  Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me.
Put the man back on.
Yes sir.
Now you're going to do just what I tell you to.  No discussion.  No hesitation.
Yes.
You're all three of you in that van?
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
Your husband?
She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it.
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
Are you okay?
Thank you.  God bless you for helping us.
They're tied with duct tape so they can't speak -- but they seem to be --
I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
God if he doesn't come back --
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
What did you do?
Lucky for them they didn't.
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
Yes?  Yes?
Try what you did before.  It worked before.  I won't talk anymore.
No.  I hear them.  They're coming upstairs.  They know!
Don't panic.  I might be wrong.  Hello?  I guess I was wrong.
Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
Or somebody else there is listening in --
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
Did you hear that click?
No.
Did you jiggle the phone?
When they first started questioning Jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  And they began beating him.  And I watched.  And I didn't feel anything ... What kind of a person am I?
You can't give up.
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
Why tell me this?
Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.
I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
Yeah sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
Theo I want you to know you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
It won't be him.
If it's the tall man -- he had one of those hair transplants.  Tufts you know.  It still hasn't grown fully in.  The other one is from the islands.  Braided hair -- very dark.
I might still get there first. The lights are with me.  How would I identify the guy who shows up at the bank?
The front door slammed.  Someone went out.  There's a different car starting.
What's going on?
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
To hide it from the I.R.S.
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
Oh my God.  I heard her scream again.  What are they doing to her?  Why can't I do anything to stop them?
I'm pretty good at signatures myself.
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
They'll recognize it's not your husband.
I'm not supposed to -- but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds.
Do you know what's in that box?
Don't say that.
Not a chance.
Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.
I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood.  That bank is our best bet.  If anybody shows up I could follow them.
Even if you found us -- what then?
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
I'm not doing too well.  What's the matter?
Black Mercedes 600S.
What do you mean?
Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.
The City National on San Vincente.
What bank?
The one in Brentwood.
You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
It's not your fault Theo.  You tried.
He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him.
I'm trying to.
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
She's gone --
What's happening?
I've got to ask somebody.
No.
Does she wear glasses?
That's not her.
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
Great.  Stay with me.  There must be a hundred kids out here.
I can hear you again clearly.
Lenore I'm here.  I'm getting out.
I'm making my turn.  I see the school up ahead.
Make a right.  You can't miss it.
I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
You're breaking up.  I can't hear you.  Theo?
That makes two of us.
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
I'm about ten blocks from the school.
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
A price on everything.
I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.
Shit stop with the money!  I never asked for a nickel.  I was just doing this.  And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
Lady you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
They say my work is somewhat derivative.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
Pictures.
Our house always needs touching up.
Sometimes I paint.
What do you do for a living?
Well you did.
I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
And that was the end of it?
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
Hey drop it okay?
A woman?
I don't know.  I hung up on somebody else a long time ago and later on I wished I hadn't of.
Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes tops.
How much time do you have left on it?
Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car dammit.
I'm not looking to get myself killed.  I just hope the battery on this phone holds out.
They say she resembles me -- dark hair ponytail very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
Tell me what she looks like.
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
What are you doing now?
I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
What about the others?
Hello?  It's just me and you again.
Another minute.
Will you please speak to me! Theo?
Just hang on.  I've got a life of my own.
Why isn't anyone answering me?
She would if she heard my voice on the phone.
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
26th off Wilshire.
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
"Theo?"
He's right?  Look don't try to put blood on my hands.  You've got one hell of a nerve siding with him!
He's right.  You'll get my whole family killed.
They don't know you.  They won't listen.
Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in.
Bottom line!  There's nothing I can do for you but tip the cops.
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
What do they need her for?
Rachel my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God she's only nine.
Stop throwing names at me.
Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
I'm with two friends now.
Don't move around.  You don't want to puncture a lung.
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.
I can't stay on this line.  I'm picking people up.  I'm already overdue.  Hello? 
I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
Fine no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?
Shit!
Please.
I'm in traffic.  There's no place to turn.
No don't.  You could lose me for good.  Don't go through that tunnel.
Listen there's an overpass coming up.  I may lose you for a minute.
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
Oh man.  These people mean business.
Elliot -- our driver.  The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired.  It was so quick.
Who?
He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club.  Claimed we'd run a stop sign.  And when Elliot was reaching for his license --
What makes you say that?
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
The cops could trace this call back to you.
No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
Okay.  The police are gonna need your full name and address.
No -- nothing.
Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
Where'd they take you to?
They tortured my husband.  Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
Why would anybody want to hurt you?
Then hang up!  Do it!
Don't lay this on me!
Because you know you'll be killing us.
Oh won't I?
You won't disconnect.
I am not involved.  Keep clicking your little wires.  You'll get someone else.  Good luck.
I realize you don't want to be involved.
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
I don't want to know --
My name is --
You're the one who's not to be believed.
I don't believe you.
You're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- I do not care.
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
I still don't see you.
I don't know what you mean.
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
Satisfied?
Talk to the man.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
You'll see her.
I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
Just relax.
Fucking "A" it is!  Any argument and I'm out of here.
It's your call.
I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
Stay there.
I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
We don't see you.
I'm here.  Where are you?
I wish it had never been invented.
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.
308-9962.
Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
Sure.
Got a phone in that van?
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
Some loyalty.
I want you all in one vehicle. Your van.  If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances.  You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got.
We can be there.
It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
What time frame have you got in mind?
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
Pass.
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
Where do we meet?
Granted.  But I don't believe they're grieving enough for their chauffeur to piss away their own futures.
There are no guarantees in this life.
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
Keep talking.
You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
You're up on your details aren't you?
They saw you kill the driver.
You got time on your side.  Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
You're making it too easy.
Whatever you say.
Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
Twenty percent.
I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
Who are you working for?
Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.
I'm in awe.
Nobody can do anything right but you!
Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
Them.  They won't be expecting us.
Who were you talking to?
Stay put!  I know my way around.
Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
Are you busting my chops or what?
Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
In your dreams.
If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
Okay Nels you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
Call me "Nels."
Who am I talking to?
Better reassure him.
What's he doing?  Answer me!
Tell the truth I was going to take a much needed leak.
Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
Why are you picking on me for?
Mind if I have a look?
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Seems not.
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Since when did you guys start changing tires?
Let her tell you.
If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
Hold on.
If you've already killed her that's fine.  I'll keep the bonds and the cash.  We got nothing to discuss.
There's no lady here.
Let me talk to the lady again.
Who are you?
Don't be afraid to say hello. Your friend with the recent transplant is in no condition to deliver that briefcase.  So I've taken on the task.
From here on I dish it out.
You sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
Who the fuck you kidding?  Send me money!
Let's have your name and address. The government will want to send you a letter of commendation.
Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?
The 405 is coming up.
Your partners are currently armed and we're not.  Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.
I thought so.
Undercover.
What kind of Treasury Dept. business is this?
Very official.  259-7881 if I recall.
Government business?
Can I make a quick call?
Doesn't everybody?
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
I already called for an ambulance.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
Hey you're not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. I took a shot. It didn't work. Did you bring the tapes?
What the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? I thought we had a deal?
And you're a dirty cop. At least I don't pretend to be something different than what I am.
When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
No. I have it. The lamp? The one with your fingerprints and her blood on it?  Remember?
They don't have a murder weapon?
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
A pass.
I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
Where are the tapes?
Look I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
You're fucked Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
You killed her!
Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.
Wired?    I ain't wired.
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
What are you doing?
If you ever want to get those tapes meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue.
Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
Do you know who this is?
Agent Hadley.
Yeah. He delivers the goods on Zammito. If we got what we wanted we'd let his brother go providing he tells us where the Van Gogh and the other paintings are.
So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
We're talking Matisse Renoir Monet. We know for sure they replaced Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve sunflowers" last week with a copy. It was on loan from the London National Gallery and they're not going to be very happy when they find out about it.
Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
Too many people know about my involvement in this.
What for? The minute I get him some other Gavone will take his place. I've been doing this for twenty years. When I retire it's not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs.
I thought you wanted Zammito?
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If I do the tapes become evidence.
Listen we know their names. They don't know the city. You'll find them. You're the FBI.
This is turning to shit. If word gets out of my involvement in this I'll go to prison.
You'll never get out of the city.
Zero.   That's all I know.
I swear man I don't know. They packed up and left a half hour ago.  All I got is one of their phone numbers in Paris.
I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now if you don't want me to keep on hurting you it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me where did they go?
Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you?
What?   This?
Hey man you can't do that!
I dunno.
Where did they go?
They left about a half hour ago.
Not today.   Where are your friends?
Uh... excuse me but don't you need a warrant or something?
Take what you've got and get out of there.
Oui.
You've already robbed the safe?
Should I call you back?
My number's going to show up on his bill!
Oui.
You're calling me on is phone?
No.
You're calling me on your cell phone right?
Oui.
You're there now?
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
Marcel?
It's me...
Who?
It's Elvis...
Hello?
Well you better get the money somehow. Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't we'll destroy the tapes.
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
Don't bullshit me Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
A million! I don't have that kind of money.
-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
It's Daniel.
Hello?
I don't trust anyone. You don't get to the top of this game by trusting people... and after all you are a thief. It's in your nature to steal. I'm just protecting my investment.
You don't trust me?
This is a considerable move up for you Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
What?
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
The job is worth about two million euros. Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money Daniel. You leave tomorrow.
C'mon Laurant America?
Thank you Marcel for that... extremely redundant explanation.
Good.   I have a job for you in America.
Uh yeah.
Hey Daniel! Hello?  Do you guys speak English?
Vincent's in the States on business.  That it?
Where's your brother?
Yeah -- you do that.
I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano.
You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table.
To tell you that we're interested in the property.
Why are you here?
I'm not here to negotiate.
Okay.   How much?
I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
-- Super what?
Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
I'm good.   Really.
You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.
No thank you.
Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?
When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
Good.   I'm good.
Good. I'm doing good. How you doin' Frankie?
We're doing everything we can to find these people. Right Tony?
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
What is happening with the world? There was a time no civilian would touch a made man. Now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. What did they take?
Yes.
They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
You have enough to worry about Angelo. You don't need my problems.
Why didn't you tell me about this?
Angelo we live and die by the rules we make. We are men of honor but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.
But you were there?
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
He missed three weeks.
Oh Frankie what's this I hear about your brother?
You know I'm kind of tired. I'm just gonna go home if it's all the same to you.
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
Uh no --
Nah that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
Someone else coming?
Good word.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
They're gonna be what?
I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
Business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
He sticks his toes in the water again we'll cut 'em off.
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
And?
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
No I'm good Angelo.
Frankie come in. Good to see you.      You want something?
You have something for me?
Thank you.
This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.
How about if I call you?
I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
Where are you staying?
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
I only have your word for that.
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
And the other half?
Half the tapes.
And for my help I would get what?
You want me to help you get out of the country?
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
I assume you want something?
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
I've got to tell you Mr. Bonanno This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
I guess we're going to find out.
Either you are incredibly brave or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors.
What kind of business?
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
For what?
If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you think again.
I don't know.
I know they won't be home tonight.
Tonight?
Jesus!
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
Raymond grab the tapes.    We're leaving!
I'm just setting my boundaries.
Why is everything an argument with you?
I'm not any closer than you are.
Because you're the closest.
Why do I always have to answer the phone?
Get that will you?
Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
Why not just steal another one?
She probably hid it at her place.    The six of us could find it in --
Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.
No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the airport and get on a plane.
We can't.
Yeah.   We just go home.
No problem.
Not a good idea. Someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. Raymond you'll steal one.
You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.
You know what makes a good get away driver?  Being able to get away!
And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.
Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
And the Vodka.
Bring me the scissors.
What about the money?
I'm going to kill him myself!
You want Zero to kill him?
Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!
Cops?
We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass.
He said to go fuck yourself.
We'll see.
And if there is then Zero can kill someone?
I just want you there in case there's trouble.
No one? Then why is Zero here?
Hopefully no one.
Where are you from?
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
We'll think of something.
That's an excellent plan.     Very comforting.
We need to rent a car and for that you need a credit card.
What for?
Sami tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us.
Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
I can't believe you didn't check.
I thought they came with batteries.
You didn't buy batteries?
Do they come with batteries?
I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
Turn on the flashlight.
Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
We still have to get out of here.
I just want to live long enough to get back to Paris. Just long enough to kill Bastaldi.
We all agreed to it. You had no way of knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.
We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.
What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me Marcel?
I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?
This ain't about that and you know it. This is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew.
Do I?
Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.
I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it.
You're sure?
No.
Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with Zammito?
You know if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
Everyone get some sleep.    We're leaving in the morning.
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
That moron.
I think he's already figured that out.
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!
Besides we don't know the city and--
I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
Did you have to use that much explosive?
You better.
I will.
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
Does it really matter what I say?
You haven't answered my question.
No that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
Hey who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
Can I trust you Sami?
What?
Some bread and...
What'd you get?
Anybody hungry?
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.
Hello?
Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
Okay. Airports train stations bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
No?
It's not your fault Daniel.
Has to be.
Hadley --
All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
All right knock it off.
I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
It makes sense. I mean do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
We have to find Sophie.
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
No.   Chicks dig me.
You didn't think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
What's the big deal? It's not like I was on guard duty or something.
I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel how would you say it went?
That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.
It's not?
I'll be Elvis and you--
Good idea.
We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.
Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
Hi. I'm one and this is two three four and five.
This is Zero.
There's just one more thing I need you to do.
Okay we're square now right?
I'll tell you when it's time.
What?
There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do.
Fine.     Ten o'clock.
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
We had a deal.
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
-- Did you set it up?
Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was just watching the news and--
It's me.
Yeah?
Fine.
A thousand dollars?
How much?
And uh I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee.
I ain't no rat.  You got money right?
Why haven't you turned us in?
Yeah I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
I'm from Belgium.
I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
I've got a way with people.
I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
Don't bullshit me.
Man I can get anything.
Guns.   Can you get them?
What do you want now?
I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him.
Hard to say.
Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
Hector don't interrupt me.
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
-- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good at it.
I just thought that--
Hey idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
Maybe you should call the police.
Great fuckin' song.
Good song though.
Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.
Oh I'm sorry.
But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
Okay boss.
Just find them!
You didn't say find them. You said "get them."
If I knew where they were you wouldn't have to find them would you?
Okay boss.   Where are they?
You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
Well I must say you're handling it very well.
Well you know when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night stick guns in my face tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
Boy you must be pissed.
Everything.
Everything?
Everything.
What'd they take?
Yeah French guys from France.
French guys?    You mean like from France?
They were all French guys.
Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
Hey boss it's not a science.
That's right. I said don't do it. Did you listen to me? No. You wanted the money. So I lent you twenty large. Now it's been three weeks and you ain't paid a dime. What do you think that makes me look like on the street? I don't do something to you and everyone will think they can skate.
You said don't do it boss.
What'd I tell you? Huh Vinny? What'd I tell you when you came to me for money? Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I not say that?  What'd I say to him?
Go look.
I don't know.     I didn't look.
What room number?
The Holiday Hotel.
What hotel?
A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now tell me what else you found?
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
And the other car?
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
What'd you guys find?
Go where?   The police are outside.
I was told to take what we have and go.
What do we do?
There must be half a million dollars here though.
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
There has to be.
Oh yeah.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
The map said to go left.
No.    145 Ridgeroad Way.
And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
Yes.
Bastaldi got the address from you yes?
No I didn't.
You can use my car.
What about transportation?
I can handle the exterior alarm but the one in the bedroom is a problem.
There's an exterior alarm system. There's also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. The control panel is in the bedroom.
Oh then we will have the house wine.
They don't have a wine list.
It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
Maybe I'm missing the obvious but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
We've got to get out of here.
Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone have I?  I don't think so because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
Hey it's not your picture on the TV it's mine. So try to be cool.
This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?
Yeah but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.
I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus why don't I ever listen to myself?
This wasn't the deal! The deal was to steal a necklace not get in the middle of a Mafia war.
No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk out with this stuff. He's planning on killing Bonanno and taking over the family.
C'mon get real will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us so we might as well take the money.
I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --
Okay.    I will have a beer.
This kind.
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
They don't serve wine here.
Hey I was told to come here by Marcel. You guys don't want me I'll be more than happy to leave.
I see.   A master criminal.
You know a little of this a little of that. I've boosted cars stole radios run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
What is it you do Sami?
I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
We both know I'm already dead.
I'm not going to leave you.
When we get to the next corner jump out.
Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.
I knew I should have driven.
This is the only American car you've ever driven.
This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
I've never driven a Cadillac before.
I'm the driver.
I'll drive.
Relax. It will be fine.
I am not comfortable with this.   I'm not a good liar.
She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
Oh man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
What are we going to do take a taxi?
How about Canada?
I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.
No.   How much?
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
What the hell is he talking about?
There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
Pink panther black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing you little turd.
A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
No!
Give it to me Sami.
No.
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
No! You can't have the baseball! You're not entitled to the fuckin' baseball!
The baseball is mine.
This is great. After everything we've been through we've got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.
Hey you know you can't this in France.
God I want to go home.
It's good.
Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
You guys used to work together?
Whatever! He never told me about the Van Gogh or any of the other paintings.
"Vase with twelve Sunflowers."

Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
No that's not Mr. Taylor.
Mr. Taylor?
We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe --  Do you know who that is?
Okay.   You can be Elvis.
C'mon I look more like Elvis than you do.
It's my idea.
-- I want to be Elvis.
I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.
You lived there. You know the city.
Me?
Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
Yeah I can see that.
Today's your lucky day Sami.
Oh Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.
Going somewhere?
I see. Well get back out on the street and find them before I "sort of" kill you.
They sort of got away.
What happened?
Just tell me who's closer to the wall?
Get in the car.
Who is closer to the wall Joey or me?
I said a clean break.
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
How's my brother?
Fuck me?   Fuck you!
Fuck you grease-ball!
And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
The hell it is.
No.   It's mine.
Yeah.   It's mine.
Anybody know about that car outside?
The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
No shit?
It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
Yeah.
You see that car?
How?
I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
Uh huh.
Mr. Zammito?
Cool.
I would like to thank you for your hospitality.  If you are ever in Paris here is my number.
I know where she went.
How are we going to do that?
Although a cartoon I feel he shares a universal theme: We are all searching for love. No?
Yeah I dig him.
Oh Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
No thank you.
No problem man.  Hey you wanna hit?
I am Raymond.     Thank you for allowing us to stay here.
Glenmorangie is very good.
Glenmorangie.
J&amp;B?
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
The new Beaujolais' come out in France next week. You like wine?
He's right. Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers" is worth?
I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.
Julien what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
You're not helping.
It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up. He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.
I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.
Where is it Sophie?
The money isn't here.
Wait here.
How do we know what room she's in?
What?
Holy shit.
Oh you think?
I think we went the wrong way.
Watch this.
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
Feel free to correct him if you want.
He speaks about himself in the third person?
He's right. The tapes give us leverage with Bastaldi.
They killed our friend. It's personal now. Besides if we do that then Julien died for nothing. The tapes are the key.
I don't know.
And how do we do that?
We don't know that for sure.
It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
You wanna tell him?
What does arresting us get them?
They send us to Zammito's house. The FBI is right across the street watching the whole thing but they don't move. A crime is going down and they don't move. Why?  Because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
I can't even hear myself think.
Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put it in yours.
You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?
-- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?
Well you know not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
And you don't speak French?
Algeria.
Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
Why?
Stick around and find out.
Who are you waiting for?
After last night I could say the same for you.
I really thought we had something special going. I can't tell you what a disappointment you've turned out to be.
It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.
Sounds boring.
I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
What are you doing?
It's not your fault.
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
No.
Can't sleep?
The lucky ones.
Who's gonna see it there?
I've been thinking about getting tattoo. You know a flower or something. On my ass.
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
You got it in a bar?
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
You ask a lot of questions.
It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago?
Something like that.
Did she break your heart?
Something like that.
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
They're not nice people.
So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
So how did you get hooked up with these guys?
It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left it last time he was here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you used it.
No I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
You like shoes?
Take a nap.
You ever hear of jet lag?
Tonight.
When do we go?
Thanks.
I wasn't expecting this many of you. I've got a few sleeping bags you can use.
I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
Okay.    Okay.
I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie I'm trying to make good here.
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
It's for you.
Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
A car.
What's this?
What are you nuts? A debt is a debt. I was thinking I'd throw a little extra work your way. You know you come down to the club make espresso for the boys... wash their cars... run some errands... things like that.
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
Yeah. I mean you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So I've decided to make it up to you.
A little?
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want Frankie?
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
So I just come by to see how you're doin'?
That's good.    That's what a stand-up guy does.
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
She seems pleasant enough.
That's why we're only breaking one arm.
Jesus Frankie I'm your brother!
-- Shut up! Don't you try to make me feel bad about this. You knew what would happen to you if you didn't pay. This is on your head not mine.  Break his arm.
Frankie I --
Well Li Mu Bai can do it.
I didn't have the heart.
She's crazy.  You should have killed her.
I'll go and make up his room!
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
How's the arm?  Still sore?
You're back!
Pardon me but I doubt you can handle her.  My wife was quite a martial arts expert.  Jade Fox killed her.  So you see this is personal.  Leave her to me.
Then leave her to me.
Yes.
This Jade Fox is a woman?
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation I can't just go in and accuse her.
Why were you spying on the Yus?
I don't care about your sword.
Wait!  I'm a friend!
Who are you?
That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
And if I use them to kill you?
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
Why do you want to teach me?
Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
Go ahead.
Real sharpness comes without effort.
On guard!
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
Like most things I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
Do you think you are a real master?
What's it to you?
Where's your master?
I do as I please.
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
Let's go!
Tell me who is your master?
I'm just playing around.
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
What's it to you?
Who are you?  Why is the Green Destiny in your possession?
Believe me I've a lesson or two left to teach you!
Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me no one to learn from.
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
You wouldn't have understood even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols!
Yes you do!  You are still my disciple.
I owe you nothing.
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting isn't it?
Shut up!
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
You're already a thief.
I'll never live as a thief!
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl you thought stealing would be fun?  You too are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
You're home late... or should I say early?
He is my defeated foe!
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
So what if I don't?
You don't seem to understand.
Don't bother.
In that case perhaps we could be of assistance.
Long.
Hello.  What is your name?
I have a guest.
This spells trouble.
Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
I'm tired now.
Don't invite danger into your father's house.
I'll socialize with whomever I please.
She's one of those.  Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.
Do you know her?
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
Put them down.
I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
Please sit.
Spare your energy.  I'll be back!
Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help you.  Hurry!
She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison.  It goes straight to the heart.
You can't die!  Tell us what poison you used!  You can't die!  Tell us the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu Bai die!
Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.
Without the Green Destiny you are nothing.
Come and get it if you can.
Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
What do I care?  You were never a real friend anyway.  But I wonder how long could you last as my enemy?
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
Where is he now?
He really loves you.  Come back to Peking with me.  We'll find a solution.
You know about Lo?
Go back to them first.  Then you can decide about Lo.
They forced me to marry!
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage but not your parents.
You sister...
I was just passing by and wondered how you were.
I'll give them to you.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
Here you must be in proper attire.
Yes from the West.  He went undercover and and followed her here
You say she killed a policeman?
Then as a sister let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
Don't distance us.  From now on let's be like sisters.
I am not an aristocrat as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
Too bad for Meng but it's not your fault or Li Mu Bai's.
His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day while in battle he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
No really?
Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
About you and Li Mu Bai?
Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
Please.
Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.
You write gracefully.  Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.
I'll write your name.  Just for fun.
You're doing calligraphy?
I'm bored.
How so?
I've missed you.
You're probably right.
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
What do you think?
You're not married are you?
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life isn't it?
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon but I haven't lived the life I want.
Sure.  No place to bathe for days sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild beating up anyone who gets in your way!
Fighters have rules too: friendship trust integrity... Without rules we wouldn't survive for long.
It must be exciting to be a fighter to be totally free!
Really?
Yes I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves however call for a sword.
You're a sword fighter too?
You're too young to understand.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
Exquisite!  You said it belongs to...
Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old.
But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.
The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on as long as I can.
The antidote exists.  She taught it to me.  The formula is simple but it takes time to prepare.  Trust me. As you have helped me let me help you.
Then you have no use for the sword.
Never!
Kneel!
Give it back!
All right.  If you can take back the sword in three moves I'll go with you.
What I've always wanted to teach you.
What do you want?
Only the sword will settle this.
Let's end this here.
Not another lecture!  On guard!
Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.
Make a wish Lo.
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
Don't ever come back.
Jen...
Go.
If you don't I'll come after you. And I won't let you off so easy.
I will.
Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again.
You must decide.  You might get tired of this life.  You might begin to miss your family.  If it were our daughter we'd look for her too.  She would miss us.  Jen... I want you to be mine forever.  I will make my mark on the world.  I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend.  Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain God will grant his wish.  Long ago a young man's parents were ill so he jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't even hurt.  He floated away far away never to return.  He knew his wish had come true.  If you believe it will happen.  The elders say "A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
Don't send me back!
It is trouble for me.
Let them look.
Your father's men are still looking for you.  They're still out there circling closer.
I am a man.  And now I've found the brightest star of all.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
Out here you always fight for survival.  You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  Slowly your gang becomes your family.  All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
And so the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find the stars so he stole my comb.
When I was a boy one night I saw a thousand shooting stars.  I thought where did they all go? I'm an orphan.  I used to look for stars alone.  I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert I'd find them.  I've been riding in the desert ever since.
Give it back.
I don't take orders from anyone.
Give me back my comb.
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
By the way I'm a real Manchurian.
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?
Still in a bad mood?  At least you're speaking.  What's your name?
You coward!
You've got quite a temper.  It's better this way.
My comb!
Well there used to be!  What's your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall or big but I'm quick as lightning.
You're tired.  You need rest.  Your horse needs water.  There's a creek up here.
Give it back!
Let's stop a moment.
With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  I can't wait any longer.  I was wrong to let you go.  Come back with me.  You'll be happy in the desert.  You'll be free there.
You shouldn't have come.
Jen!
Lo?
I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit.
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
Save your strength.
Shu Lien...
Mu Bai hold on.  Give me some hope...
That can't be!  Everything has an antithesis!  Why not this?
My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master.  There is no antidote.
We followed Jade Fox.
Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?
What happened?
Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.
I'll look around and catch up later.
What about you?
We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.
You're right but I don't know what to do.  I want to be with you... just like this.  It gives me a sense of peace.
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble.
Your hand rough and callused from machete practice... All this time I've never had the courage to touch it.
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
All right.  I'll write you an introduction.  Take it to Wudan. Wait there for news from me.
Don't you want to see her again.
She's out there but I doubt she'll show herself.  We'll keep our eyes open.  Sooner or later she'll come for the girl.
You think Jade Fox will show up?
Just be patient with me Shu Lien.
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
I thought by giving away the sword I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her her husband might object.
For her they might make an exception.  If not I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
But Wudan does not accept women.
That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox and she'll marry.
She needs direction... and training.
I knew she would intrigue you.
You did your job well.  But this girl... I saw her last night.
My job was to get the sword back without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life or her father's.
True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
I admit getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it.
Well we had talked...
Then why did you come?
I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
No I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
No not yet...
Have you questioned him yet?
It was Bo Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's.  Were you involved?
No.
Did you see who posted it?
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
Jade Fox?  Impossible.
What have you discovered?
But something is going on at the Yu household.
Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast suspicion on Governor Yu.
Perhaps.
Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.
First I must visit my master's grave.  It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet to avenge his death.  And yet I'm thinking of quitting.  I must pray for his forgiveness.
Come with me to Peking.  You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times.
So what will you do now?
It's time for me to leave it behind.
You use it justly you're worthy of it.
Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
I don't understand.  How can you part with it?  It has always been with you.
I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.
The Green Destiny Sword?  You're giving it to Sir Te?
Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
What was it?
No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
You were enlightened?
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
I left the training early.
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy I hardly get any rest.
Yes.
Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.  He said you were practicing deep meditation.
Fine.
Good.  And how are you?
It has.  How's business?
Mu Bai...It's been too long.
I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...
Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
A female criminal!  Now that's news!
Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
A murderer?
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
But don't be too lenient.
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.
That's good.  Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.
We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.
I heard Sir Te lost something.  And now Madame Te's not feeling well...
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.  She's being so considerate.
Father!  Let me avenge my mother's death.
If you surrender now you'll suffer less.  But if you resist I won't stop until you're dead.
"We'll settle this at midnight on Yellow Hill."  Good the fox is out of her hole.
What does it say?
They're gone.
Father!
You're mistaken.  We're just street performers.  We were rehearsing.
We must avenge mother!
It's Jade Fox!
The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs.
What do you have in mind?
Sir Te can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
This is a delicate matter.
We must be careful.  Governor Yu is a court official and in charge of security.  Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  It might get Sir Te in trouble.
Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
But the sword could be in his compound.
Yes though I doubt he's involved in this.
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
When it comes to emotions even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I'll give him an earful!
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
I don't know...
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
Please Sir Te what is it?
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me and I think of you as my own daughter.
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.
All right.  I'll act as the sword's custodian.
Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise he'll never be able to start anew.
This is Li's personal sword a great hero's weapon!  He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.

The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith.  They've got two kids a girl about fifteen and a boy younger Jennifer and Thomas.
Don't shout Larry.  I'm three feet away.
I think he's dead!
Mike!  Mike can you hear me?
Keep trying.
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
You get anything on Smith?
It was stolen.
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
What'd you find out?
It's me Chief.  Can you talk?
Talley.
I'll make the call.
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
I understand.
Sonny's a fuckup.  If he pulls this off fine--life goes on.  But if the cops end up with those disks we cut our losses.
The best.
Our people out there they good people? People in the right place?
What do you want to do?
I hate that Mickey Mouse bastard.  I hated his father and I hate Sonny too. Always with the tan.
Yes sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
And by doing so he would've known we have spies in his organization.
You wanted to let Sonny handle it.  I would've moved in when we first found out.
Jesus Christ it's a clusterfuck.
The house is in flames Benza's accountant is with the cops and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood.
It's happening right now.
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day I want to own him.
Bullshit--a man will do anything to save his family.  Who's running the show up there?
He knows better than that.
Put our people on the scene.  Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.
<u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game Phil--we have to handle this.
You should warn them Sonny.
I took the call from Glen personally. They're still in Smith's house.
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
Worst case it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer and we go directly to jail do not pass Go.
No way.  I tell them that Old Man is gonna handle this from back there.
If the Feds get those disks the East Coast is gonna take a hit too.  You should let them know.
What he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?
I guess not too.  How much information is in the house?
I guess not.
You think we should take that chance?
Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's three kids.  They'll give up the cops will arrest them and that's that.  Why would they search the house?
You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
But if you stay in this house I can promise you this --
Bullshit!
You won't die if you let me help.
Mars watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
I have contacts in Los Angeles.  Lawyers and judges who can help you.
<u>Get on the floor</u>!
You're not goin' anywhere!  Get on the fuckin' floor!
I'm going to my desk.
Stay down!  Stay <u>down</u> goddamnit!
Am I talkin' raghead?!  I want your car! <u>Gimme the goddamned keys</u>!
The car.  All you want is the car?
Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you up then we're gonna take your car.
Who sent you?
She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
Jen?  Are you all right?
I'm not going to die for this!
Then we might as well die rich.
That money's fucked up your brain. Talley's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up and we'll all be fuckin' killed!
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
It's over.  We have to give up.
Kevin you're so fuckin' stupid...
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
What are you talking about?
If we don't escape we gotta get the word out about the cash.  That's how we'll stay alive.
Celebrate what?  Going to prison?
For chrissake <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
There is no way out.
We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
We're fucked.
I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
Like what?
Not if they're looking at something else.
That's crazy Dennis.  The cops will see us.
These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.
That's why we tied him dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?
Jesus first Mars now you.  You two need anti-depressants.
Everyone knows what we look like Dennis. We won't be able to hide.
Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
Jesus.  What is this?
You're being stupid.  Check out the bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a window --
I was <u>there</u> Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!
It's about Mars --
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
I have to tell you something --
We should give up.  All we're doing is making it worse.
Stop it!  They found the truck Kev! They're already behind us!
We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
We're surrounded by houses dumbass. Every house has a car in the garage. All we have to do is take one.
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.
What if he's dead?  What if you killed him?
Shut up goddamnit!  Just calm down!
That woman's gonna call the cops.
I didn't know he would have a gun!  It just went off!
There's fuckin' blood all over you!
Because if you don't take the chance you're already dead.
We got jobs man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
Not if they don't catch us Kevin.
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
Try to act cool okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
Mars?!  Whattaya think dude?  Out here on the edge no one around it's perfect right?
C'mon Dennis this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
Give up Dennis.  Let these people go. At least you'll have your life.
It ain't been a good day Chief.
There's a million dollars in there maybe <u>two</u> million.  I'll give you half.
Give up.
Two hundred thousand cash right in your pocket no one needs to know.
You picked a bad house to hole up in son.
Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket show you something?
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?
Only if you try to grab me.  We could've shot you from the wall.
You got a sniper out there gonna shoot me?
You've already helped yourself once Dennis; be smart again.  If you save his life it'll help when you get to court.
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
If you won't let me come in then put him outside.
Fuck that!  You bastards will jump me!
Let me come get him.
Okay.
Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that.
We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead.  They think you murdered him.
We been through that.  Forget it.
I need you to let me talk to Mr. Smith.
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
The one and only.  We got a little problem out here Dennis.
That you Talley?
I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.
You're a funny guy Talley.
I gotta piss real bad.
What?
Hey Dennis?  Can I let you in on a personal secret?
The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox you good to go?
I'll give you these people.
That's not going to happen Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
I'm here.
Talley?
We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I got gasoline all over in here!
It's over now Dennis!  Don't hurt anyone.
I got these people!  You try to come get me I'll kill every fuckin' one of them!
We're not coming in there by force okay? No one wants to hurt you.
Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
How about the cop?
Mr. Kim didn't make it Dennis.  He died.
You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself.
All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the house-to-house.  Okay Dennis I want to explain your situation --
They're fine.
How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there do you?
Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
We're cool.
We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
Yeah.  I'm Rooney.
The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?
You with the cops?
Take'm back upstairs but don't tie'm like before.  That little fuck untied himself anyway.
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
Aw Jesus not more of this.
What about my father?
I'm getting a doctor!
Use more ice.
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
Hey I've got a situation here in case you haven't noticed.
My father needs a doctor.  <u>Please</u>.
Shut up and sit down.  You think someone's gonna make a house call?
He needs a doctor.
My father.
Who else is here?
Jesus get upstairs and find out!  If he took those kids we're fucked!
I don't know.
<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
I overheard him with the girl.
You mean he <u>left</u> as in went out the front door?
Fuckin' A.
I like it here Dennis.  I'm never going to leave.
You got something to say?
Dennis.
Cops want to be rich like everyone else. All we have to do is share.  And if he wants someone to swing for the Chinaman we'll give'm Mars.
They'll cut the power.
What the fuck is that?
We don't have time!
I got the gasoline --
The cops are comin'!
Find something Kevin.  Don't just stand there.  And tie this bastard too.  I don't want him waking up and goin' Rambo on us.
Find something:  Extension cords rope wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
That's right.  That's a good idea Mars.
You can't run with suitcases.
We can take it with us.
We're trapped in a house.
Who gives a shit Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house you can hide.
Pretty sure I do.  Yeah here we go --
You have his address?
Keeps to himself more like.
Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that?
Have Louise run the name 'Mars Krupchek' through DMV and NCIC.  Tell her to list the tattoo as an identifier.
That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus he works for me too.
Can you identify this man?
You fucked up Glen.
Are you out of your mind?
I don't eat junk food.
Donuts here any good?
We have to own this guy Marion.  We don't want him dead; we need to use him.
Okey-doke.
He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
It won't be a problem.
Talley lives here.  I don't know if the place has security or not.
Canyon Country.
What hospital?
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
Goddamnit tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
I heard he's fucked up.  They're taking him to the hospital.
You worry about your end.  I got my side covered.
If things get wet we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
What do you mean?
What if it goes south?
An hour tops.  Might be sooner.
Give me an ETA.
L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera.
You'd better be kidding.
I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> FBI.  This one's a fake.
If you shoot me he'll kill your daughter.  Do you want to lose both of them?
I'll kill you!  You won't get the other disk!
First my girls.  I get my girls you get the other disk.
All right.  Now the second one.
Close.
Where is it?
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
You said they would be here!
They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.
You said they would be here goddamnit! Where are they?
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
You got ten minutes.  If you're one minute late we won't be here to find.
Yeah.
Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on the road west of town?
I think you got no choice.
Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway you bring my family.  We'll trade.
What do you want?
I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.
I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what you motherfucker?  I have you.
How did you get this number?
That's okay.  I love you anyway.
I'm scared shitless.
I'm in no rush.  Maybe later we can talk.
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
You sure?
Why don't you guys grab some dinner at the Thai place?  I'll meet you there as soon as I can.
But they're not here yet.  Tell me about <u>you</u>.
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke then everything happened so fast --
We'll see you in a couple of hours.
Can we talk some more when you get here?
I still see that boy's eyes.
You're hiding Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
I need to work out some stuff.
I know.
He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.
Better than you getting killed!  Don't touch that gun!  Daddy says --
Shh they'll hear you!
You leave that gun alone!
Go!  If you get out maybe you can help the police!
I'm not gonna leave you!
You go Thomas.  You get out and I'll stay with Daddy.
We can't carry him.
No!  I'm not going to leave Daddy with them!
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
Mine too.
That big asshole nailed my windows.
No one's coming.
Be quiet!  Listen!
Ow!  Shit!
Stop it.
Now we can do whatever we want.
Kevin's gone your daddy's gone everybody's gone.
You'd better get out of here!  Kevin's coming back!
I don't know what you're talking about.
Kevin left without you.
How about dog shit?
Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
We're hungry.  You're going to cook.
What?
We can't make the microwave work.
What do you want?
What I want is to help my father.
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
I don't drink beer.
Want one?
Yes.
Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door you understand?
How can we get out?
All three of us will go but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
I can't go without Thomas.
Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
What happened?
Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
What do you want?
If my father dies they'll charge you with his murder.  Can't you make Dennis see that?
He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
Kevin my father needs a doctor.
Whatever.
Thanks for the shirt.
Either I'm going to tie you or Mars will tie you.  Which do you want?
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
You gotta pee?
Mars?  What are you doing?
Please get away from me.
Get in the car.  <u>Now</u>.
What's going on?
Keep your head down.
What are we going to do about Mike?
We have to cordon off the streets then evacuate these houses.
Holster your guns!
He said something about a girl --
Are civilians inside?
Another minute.  Please --
That's enough.
I need to talk to him.  Alone.
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
I'm Jeff Talley the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know your children are okay.
He.  Can't.  Answer.
Just one question.  Please.
I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.
What are you doing?!  Stop that!
Smith!  Wake up!
Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
His cell number belongs to the Smiths.  I think it's real Chief.  I think this boy is inside that house.
It's a crank Louise.  C'mon don't waste my time with that!
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
Is something wrong with Jane?
Get everyone out here.  Then call the Sheriffs.  Tell them we have a possible hostage situation.
What's that Chief?  Say again.
That's not enough.
York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.
Where are they?
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
What are you talking about shot?  What happened?
Stand by.
Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.
What's wrong with the radio?
Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
Did you find Jane and Mandy?
They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.
She didn't answer.
You have her cell number?
I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
Go.
Chief base.
Tell her I'm almost home.
I know the one.
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
Go Chief.
Louise?
Get a phone number for the Smiths.
Go Chief.
Louise?
We only have eight officers on duty Chief.
Jesus Christ Louise we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.
I pulled Mickey and Dreyer off the minimart.
Then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  Mickey you up?
He didn't say.
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered the door.
Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.
One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?
Goddamned small town bullshit.
Let it go Captain.
-- then when you get him you damn near assault the man in the ambulance!  <u>What</u> <u>is going on</u>?
Don't question me Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.
I want to know what in hell you're doing.
And now I'm taking it back.  We're getting Smith out of the house.
Excuse me?  <u>You</u> requested our help.  You turned over command --
You've been here all day Chief.  Take a break.  See your family.  If I need you I'll call.
You want me to stick around I could --
Then I think we should wait.  Do you agree?
No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
If we have a man dying in there we'll have to go in.
He says that his father's hurt.
That's why you get the big bucks Captain.
Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
If you go in you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  The whole place would go up.
Jesus.  He must've siphoned it from the cars.
He says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
Order your men to stand down.
Then get your men off the wall!  You breach that house we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I <u>know</u> this guy Captain -- I can talk to him.
Maddox!  You got that?
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
Sounds like you know the job.
Don't crowd the house.  The alpha's a kid named Rooney.  He's amped up and volatile.
Do it.
Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox the primary negotiator --
I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?
Yes sir.
Mickey?  Call the state Homicide Bureau. Don't touch anything just sit back and wait.
Go Mickey.
Chief it's Mikkelson.
It's mine.  Talley.
Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment friends family anything we can find out about this guy.
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney white male twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
Go Mickey.
Chief Mikkelson.
Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
It's right in front of us.
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
We're out two minutes me and Dreyer.
Help me goddamnit we can get the disks later!
Where's the office?
The kids are in here!
They've been in there all day.
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
Not until the man calls.
We've got to get those kids out of there!
What does he have on you?  I know why I'm doing this but what does he have on you?
You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word we move.
What are you people going to do?
Think of me that way and you won't fuck up.  I'll handle the Sheriffs.
Special Agent Jones.
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
What?
What's my name?
How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.
Don't worry about what we used to be.
You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.
Don't be funny Chief.  You can't afford it.
Are all of you named Jones?
Okay here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.
No!  They're right here --
Are the disks still in your room?
Charles G. Benza.  They're coming!
Who is it?
Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax --
Try Al.  See if you can open Al.
I don't see any people names.  It's all businesses.
Look for names.  Does it say whose taxes they are?
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
Can you open them?
Yes sir.
If I get Rooney into the back of the house can you find the disks without being caught?
I can get into the den.  The office is right across the hall.
Can you get into the office?
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
I thought they locked you in your room.
But I might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around.  Then I could open the disks here in my room.
Dennis won't let me go to the desk.  He makes me sit on the floor.
I think he was working on them today so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
He has lots of disks.
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
What do you want me to do?
I'm serious Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
Okay.
I need your help with something.  But if you think those guys could catch you then I don't want you to do it okay?
I think so.
The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
Is my daddy okay?
If I try to climb out they'll see me on the security cameras.  They would see you outside too --
I've got the boy on the phone.  He's using a cell phone.  What was that son?  I didn't hear you.
They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm open.
That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
In my room.
Where are you right now?
We're okay.
How about you and your sister?
Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
Slow down Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot?
Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him.
This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name son.
How do I reach him?
That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
A man has my family.  Gold watch here. Dark tan.
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
Yes.
Did you find the disks?
He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk.
I don't know what you're talking about.
They're still in the house.
Where are my children?
Smith will know.
These disks . . . where are they?
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
You want . . . Marlon and Al.
When this phone rings you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want you get your family.
You will re-assume command.  In two hours a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
Marlon and Al....
You can let go.
Can we let go?  You past your shock and all that we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?
These guys are going to take hold of you. Don't freak out.  It's for your own good.
What do you want?
Don't just fuckin' sit there dumbass. Do you understand?
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
Who are you?
I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
Where's your gun?
You don't want another dead child on your conscience.
What do you mean by that?
We're almost home you and me.  Keep your shit together.  This isn't L.A.
Your phony FBI assholes.
My people are good to go.  You know who I mean?
I guess we do.
I guess we each have something the other wants.
I'll go in that fuckin' house right now! I'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> FBI you COCKSUCKINGMOTHERFUCKER!!  And I've got <u>Smith</u>!  <u>I've got Smith</u>!!
<u>You want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
You dumb fuckwad cop you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
A bird cage.
What is it?
Oh my God.
One way to find out.
Do you think it goes all the way across?
This is how you play God.
This is how you make dinosaurs?
Quiet!
Eric!
He's smart Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
After what you've seen today you really think your son could be alive?
A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
Still you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
And tell your wife to stop making so much noise! We're food to these damn animals.
ERRR-IIIC!
I would completely support that.
Either that or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently.
You mean it?
We should try fishing again.
But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
He could have died.
How would you have helped Eric?  He needs you Paul. He needs us.
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there not Billy.
You couldn't have made that jump.
My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.
I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
We're not going anywhere I promise.
Eric its okay. You'll be right behind me.
Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men we stick around huh?
Sweetheart you're okay.  You're okay.  You're okay.
I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on him when he...
What?...WHAT!?
Think.
I don't remember
When did you have it last?
I don't know. I don't have it with me.
He would have been safe. Completely entirely suffocatingly safe.  I would have him to see more of the world than Enid Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid Oklahoma. And so yes it's my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that you have to be here.
That one time was just the bumper.
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is its was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
Well what?
I want to find them too but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
We have to help him.
It's not safe.
He's this way.
Udesky.
Eric!
Eric! Are you here?
Its not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
No it's...
I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
I filmed this the morning they left.
That's him. Thats Eric!
Eric...
Young adult.
Just drop it Paul!
What did you say!
Nothing.
What did you say?
Nothing.
What?
Oh don't worry about that.
Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after you don't come crying to me.
Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.
Well what's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
Dr. Grant says this Dr. Grant says that...
No Dr. Grant says...
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.
So do you.
You look good.
People change.
You hate to swim.
Twenty twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
How much weight have you lost?
Nothing you haven't seen before.
Sorry.
We called everyone did everything we could. Because of all the controversy over this island no one will step in. Costa Rica says it's a no-fly zone it's their own damn fault. Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy -- said we should "accept the inevitable." You believe that?
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
Her new boyfriend.
Don't worry honey. We'll circle around and come back.
We can't just...
What's a bad idea?
He says it's a bad idea!
What?
Amanda Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
From what I understand it's pretty much whatever we want.
Well I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.
We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
...once-in-a-lifetime.
We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.
Amanda and I well we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos K2 the Nile...
It is truly whats the word? Inspiring.
First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts Amanda and I have admired your work for years.
Where is it?
You had the phone the whole time?
What about Eric?
Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive thats where he's headed.
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
He's not a kill he's still alive.
He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill wounded.
Here!
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
Who's that?
He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.
How low?
You see that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know that right now more than anything your Dad would want to know that we're safe. Okay?
He loves you too.
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad okay? He's very very very clever very very brave and he loves you ever very much.
then we should...
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.
Just hold on.
Where's Dad?
DAD!
PAUL!
It won't hold!
Eric!
Sure.
He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
Dr. Grant was.
I thought you were an expert.
I dont know.
They set a trap  They actually set a trap.
They couldnt climb up so they were trying to get us to come down.
About a thousand feet above it actually.  Most mountain-climbers remember how tall that mountains were.
Thirty-thousand I think. Closer to the top.
So Mr. Kirby tell me when you climbed K2 did you base camp at 25- or 30000 feet?
I didn't know there were two islands.
That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna. The second island.
I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!
NO!
I CAN GET HIM!
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
Billy I can't talk to you now.
Alan I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
We need to keep moving.
KEEP GOING!
ALAN!
Ah yes the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
We could co-write a paper.
We should take it with us to signal any planes.
It looks intact.
That's because it wasn't on their list. Who knows what else they were up to?
I don't remember that on InGen's list.
Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
Baryonyx?
They never got that big.
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
How would you classify it?
I don't think so.
Is it a rex?
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away.  And besides you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people.
Listen Alan I really appreciate you bringing me along.
Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic.
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
That does sound lucky.
No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
Even with what I pay you you could get a better bag.
What?
They're here.
Absolutely not.
Not if it can't dig.
It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
You rented an automated litter box.
Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.
We'll be broke in four weeks.
How was your trip? Profitable?
Alan don't be afraid to evolve.
A well-accepted theory.
When I met you I thought that one day millions of years ago all the dinosaurs became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me otherwise. When conditions changed dinosaurs changed. They became other things. They evolved.
Goodbye Alan.
Okay. Goodbye Ellie.
Let me know if I can help Alan. Youre bad about asking for help but please ask me. Anything anytime.
I'd better get going.
The last of my breed.
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
It was never easy but before Jurassic Park you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
Good luck with the fund raising.
To a degree we never imagined.
You think they could talk to each other?
We've done cranial scans and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
I try not to.
You remember the sounds they made?
My favorite.
Raptors mostly.
Anything good?
Really?  What do you do there?
So Mark's working at the State Department now.
Sorry Alan it's been six years.
He used to know me.
He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
Hmm?
The population will Stabilize eventually. They'll adapt to fit different roles.
What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
No we're not.
We're safe!
Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a minute would you?  They look worried.
No. I couldn't see.
Eric do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
You're right.
You should.
It's strikes me now I never told her that.
She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
The lady you called how do you know she can help us?
Something must've scared them.
Bonitas.
Exactly. The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. To be able to touch them. That's what Billy wanted to do.
But then you never get to go in space.
See I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully everything you really need to learn you can learn it from the ground.
I want to be an astronaut.
I have a theory that there's two kinds of boys. Those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.
No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
Do you have any kids?
Then we go home?
We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.
Closer you get to the water the bigger things get.
Why?
Are you sure?
We need to head for the coast.
I stayed pretty close to the compound Figured if anyone came to look for me that's where they'd start.
How much of this island have you explored?
Mine's new.
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
Know what this is?
I dunno. I mean it was kind of preachy. Chaos-this chaos-that. And like to me the guy seemed kind of high on himself.
What did you think?
Yeah.
Did you read Malcolm's book?
The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
Found this but the battery's dead.
Any weapons radios?
When InGen cleared out they left a lot of stuff behind.
Back then they hadn't tried to eat me.
The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
Which one do you prefer?
You're Alan Grant aren't you?  I read both of your books.
You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
They'll never make it. I mean they can't manage when the cable goes out.
On the island.
In Costa Rica?
Eric your parents are both here.
Stan.
Well we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
Whatever you do don't call the U.S. Embassy. They won't do a God Damn thing.
It's no use Dr. Grant. No use.
Billy!
Back out! Move!
Amanda!
But you never came across just one.
Well that's good.
There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid Oklahoma. The "plus" is for bathroom fixtures fireplaces accessories patio furniture. Stuff like that.
There is no Kirby Enterprises is there?
You can stick with us or you can go and look for him. Either way you're probably not getting out of here alive.
Dr. Grant we're not leaving without our son.
No I'm sorry but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left something to get us off this island.
Sure you have. You wrote that book...
I have never been on this island!
We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.
Mr. Kirby trust me on this island there is no such thing as safe. We have to get back in this plane...
Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
What the hell is going on? What are they doing?
This plane can not land!
Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight we'll explain this all in a jiffy.
Let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports emerging markets -- I've made some friends in high places. In this case the Costa Rican government.
That's hard to believe.
I'm flattered but I've taken this little adventure tour. And with the air restrictions they've imposed after the incident in San Diego you cant fly low enough to see anything of interest.
No no see Dr. Grant you're the best. You've seen these animals in the flesh. No one else has come close to you.
That's a very nice offer Mr. Kirby but I'm afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can refer you to a number of highly qualified...
Now for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special something...
Hmmm.
I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
You know I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
Well sir I am a great admirer of yours and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
What can I do for you Mr. Kirby?
Yeah stick around you might learn something.
You mind if I ride with you?
Or worse we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.
Alright we know who we're looking for.  Play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again.
If you guys want in fine.  Just remember this is our jurisdiction.
Every step of the way.
Cooperate?
I'm sure if our departments cooperate we can find out the truth.
That's the point.  He slipped up and he's desperate now.  And that means he's all the more dangerous.
If what you're saying is true then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
Our agency monitors all threats very carefully and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training the connections and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage but the charges were later dropped and he sprang the service.
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31 no priors and he's been working for the military for ten years.
Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
What can I do for you?
Yeah?
Captain Doyle?
Alright stay on the phone.
What do you think?
You set to go -
We're by Ozone...
Where are you?
Yeah?
No I mean ours motherfucker! If I go down everyone's going with me - you and your crew especially! You won't get protection you won't get the trucks - nothing!
You mean shut your ass down!
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
So what?
He walked in on Fleming and took him out.
The shit just hit the fan brother. That bitch has a partner and he got away from me.
What do you need?
It's Marvosa -
Well why don't you sit this one and get some rest...you look like shit. CUT TO INT TUBBS' APARTMENT - NIGHT
It's just...catching up with me you know?
Something wrong with you Marvosa?
That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?
Outside hacker?  What the fuck are you talking about?
Hey what they did on their time was their business you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag wherever he is.
Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker you know some connection.
Where do you come from Marvosa?
Gotta come from somewhere...
It's kind of a funny coincidence isn't it?
What?
Well don't you think that's odd?
Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -
Yeah...
Did you start out area six?
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
When did you join the force?  You know the police force the place you work...
What?
Our getaway car.  You said a cell phone?
What's this?
Fine -
I'll take the south end -
I'm sure you can handle it.  Now I want to do an alley-to alley sweep beginning at the north and south ends from Marine to 30th.  Foot beat units continue on the boardwalk.
These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
Right behind you.
Let's roll -
Fine...
Find out for me.
I don't know shit.  Maybe she was looking for love...
But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
Sarah Williams left the bar with Trudell on her own.
What did the six-toes have to say?
I didn't hit shit!
Did you hit him?
Don't worry -
Don't take any chances.  Call for back-up this time!
We're all gonna fan out!  C'mon let's do a sweep of the alleys -
I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
Great. Well that changes a lot...
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
What the hell is this Marvosa!!
Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--
I don't know how you're used to doing things Marvosa but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!
It happened too fast.  He was in the back quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking Jesus!!!
He busted the back window with his feet and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
What the hell happened?
we've got kidnapping grand theft auto burglary and two counts of murder on you and I'm gonna see to it personally that it sticks!
You can cut the shit asshole--
Did you report it stolen?
Bullshit...
It wasn't in the cards.
I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop...
I'll live...
Are you alright?
Yeah it was opened -  with a goddamn screwdriver!!!
I didn't break in - the back door was open!
So...  to get the car back you break into her house.
She stole my car!!
I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
And who are you?
Alright where is she?
Nothing!  He didn't do nothing!
And what did he do to the girl?
I was just having a little fun -
Alright alright!  We were just fucking with him..you know?
Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers you got that!!
Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
Hell he probably raped her in the lot dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
Did he harm the girl?
Yeah...the guy was psycho - I was just tying to protect the girl...
And he took a swing at you?
The guy was looking for trouble shoving people around being an asshole...
Well let's get his ass to the garage!  Some lead...
He said he was following up some lead.
And where the hell is Marvosa?
Could explain why Fleming was there.
Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
Well it's just kind of a coincidence isn't it?  Stanton and Fleming both started in '83 both in area six...both in Vice?
Something I don't already know?
Well read this -
No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
Did you read today's paper?
That's great Zydowski you tech guys are really on the ball.  Harding - call the print lab at the FBI run the prints through their library see if it's less screwed-up than ours...
That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
What?  Wait a minute -
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field convicted for soliciting two years ago.
Yeah?
You won't like this.  I ran the prints from the house.  No police record on your suspect--at least not in our files. But there is a match on the girl.
Zydowski.  It's about time.
LAPD data center reports a breach on the system.  An outside hacker has accessed files on Detectives Fleming and Stanton...and yours too Marvosa.
Yeah?
Captain?
Good! We'll get it to the nearest outlying station and hold it for prints - we're on our way -  You coming?
They found the getaway Mercedes a parking garage north of Venice. It checks out.
Speak of the devil.
I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
Where is he?!!
I don't know - but he's from the FBI.
Who is it?
Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
Neither did I.  I'll make it up to you I promise...
No -
Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?
Where the hell is my car?
Yeah.
There's something I've been meaning to ask you Stephanie.
So you know about Marvosa and Stanton and all of them.
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
What happened with the tape?
I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.
What did you do then?
I had it all on tape...
Found what?
And what did you do?
Yeah...they did.  One girl...
Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
I was there and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
No but I'm listening.
Six months ago a police lieutenant named Charles Fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note you may have heard of it...
What exactly did you see?
No.  A witness.
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
I had to get away!  My life was in danger!
Well you figured wrong!  And now I'm public enemy number one.  You have an answer for that?
I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
Why did you set me up?
You'll find out - soon enough.
What's going on here?
Only on dates?
No.
You always carry a gun with you?
Figure you would have tried it already.
You know you don't seem afraid of much either.  How do you know I'm not going to try to rape you?
No...
Mind if I turn out the light?
You're the mysterious type right?
No...
You got any family?
Seattle.
Where up north?
Up north.
So where are you from?
Don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.
Are you going to be alright?
I'm going to need a way to get there.
I can't help you anymore Jimmy. I'm sorry.
I told you I'm not going anywhere! I got my whole life in this place!  I'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb.
Tubbs these people mean business.
I'm not going anywhere!
That was her - the girl... We have to go.
Shit we just started.  But I better log out of this.
It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
Ahh shit.  We're pretty much tapped out.  I'm getting denied access all over the place...
And look at the balances...these aren't police salaries...
Both at the same bank...
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
A bank?
OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas.  And that's Switzerland's country code.
What else is new?
You know this time there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time.
I gave all that up.  I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment.  It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore...  ...some things never change I guess.
So...what happened to you Jimmy?  I figure you'd be in some far off place somewhere living on the edge like the good old days.
I'll access the LAPD mainframe but we gotta be careful - that one's kind of tricky -
How about Marvosa and the others?
OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.
I got a lot of free time you know what I mean?
I knew I could count on you.
I don't but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
Donut?
Let's see what we got...
1490...Breckinridge...
OK I'm logged on to the municipal network.  I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county.  None of them live in Hollywood.  Do you remember the address?
OK...where do you want to start?
I've got a better idea...
Shit what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
Alright...alright...you've saved my ass enough times.  What do you want to do?
I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
Oh man...what happened?
I have nowhere else to go Tubbs I need your help!
Shit you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
They're inside the department they're everywhere - it's not safe.
You gotta turn yourself in. Before it's too late -
It was self-defense Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something I don't know what -
Jimmy do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -
Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
Oh shit shit shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
I killed them.
And?...
Look Jimmy you know I haven't seen you in eight years you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!
No...
Yeah c'mon in...you scared the hell out of me!
Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?
Holy shit -
This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
Operator I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
Please...
Jesus man...
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
Just what did you get yourself into Jimmy?
Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
You are drunk.  You know it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up but I really got to -
Yeah...
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
No...I'm in some trouble...
Well where are ya what are ya drunk?
Tubbs it's me.
Jim Trudell!  Bravo company!
What?
Not with this...
You don't seem afraid of much.
Screw him!
What would your - boyfriend - think?
Bartender said there are motels south of here.
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
Ditched you?
Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
Are you a regular there?
Well you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
Hop in.
I'm stranded out here.
Mind if I come along for the ride?
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
You must be going somewhere.
Well I've kind of had my fill of the place you know what I mean?
Where are you going?
County jail - get in.
Where am I going?
Then what did you do play canasta?
No.  It wasn't like that!
Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
What?
Did you have sex with her?
No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
Nahhh...
Yeah and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me go ahead...
Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
Long gone huh?
Long gone... MARVOSA Well you won't mind if I don't take your word for it right?
Where is he?
Don't you guys ever knock?
With the United Nations High Commission on Refugees.  Famine relief.
Doing...?
No.  I was in Namibia...
You in Miami workin' on your complexion...?
Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.
Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics darlin'.  Where ya' from?
Lemon or lime?
Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or Boodles.
Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...
...eliminated one.  SWAT's on the next two...
There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...
She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...?
They may have already so we protect the living.  Proof she's alive?
They'll kill Gina.
Then that's it.  Change the mission statement. Crockett stays in.  He keeps working up the ladder.  The local importers get a pass for the time being.
With Sonny.  110%.
So what's gonna persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his deliveries...?
Oh yeah...
He any good?
Sal Maguda.
I got to know.  There is never any room for "personal"...
"And" what?
And...?
I was the kids' godfather.
About the Stevens family I'm sorry.  I know you were close to them.
Grieve elsewhere.
We know these people...!
Turn around.
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
What's your twenty?
Yeah.
Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?
Just came in.  She's still alive.
You can't.
Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
It's a rip and a hit.
What do you think?
They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
Where's the new drop point...?
José Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
Yeah?
Three wakes off the back of those boats.  Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull?
Okay.  What'd you spot...?
Good.
He is fine.  And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful things get messy.  When they get messy the wrong people die...  Everybody gets it.
Recruit us to do what?
...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  We don't know who's straight up who's not...
No you don't Jim.  'Cause if I close this down you got nothing to make a phone call about.  And my guys don't have a week for a Feeb bureaucratic process.  Every hour longer they're in there they risk exposure.  So right here right now they're back in or I pull them out and close you down.  What's it going to be?
I got to talk to my ADO...
Yes you do...
I don't know.
Of course.  From my side I don't WANT to know anything about what you're doing or how you do it...  So let me know if we're on...
I mean <u>full</u> disclosure.
Sure.
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
You need to consider a few issues.
They knew about Alonzo <u>before</u> he made a move on them.  They had our operation.  They've cut into us.
Tell them what you want.
Not anymore.  This is a distribution network out of South Florida moving poly-drug loads crystal meth through coke to Nashville Atlanta Memphis Cleveland.  And computer fraud identity theft. It's like that.
We're not certain!
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
We're not certain...
Deal.
Make it 35.
Make it 40%.
25% discount on the load.
My end?
Two main players plus three.
How many?
And our friend don't like the rest of the people bringin' the merch to you.
I got the item.
Okay.  You got the "item"?
All I want to know is the where and the when.  Spare me mini moves progress reports and bullshit.
Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
So...?
It still is.  I'm so in this I don't know which way is up... All I know is I won't let anything bad happen to you.  Just like I said.  And I know we can't ever see each other again.  And we never will.
I know.  And now?
No part of it wasn't real.
No.
What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant is that it?
...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush.  They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They <u>will</u> wait till they got the goods before they do the deed.
If they attack you...
Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy whites.
Yero by himself?
I'll be on board by noon.
...in the morning.
Would you?  Because if you couldn't I would be very lonely... I would have left the only world I know and have known since I was seventeen.  But none of this will happen.  So it doesn't matter.  Because we are on the Guajira Peninsula.  And all you see around you...look around... is Archangel de Jesus Montoya- Londono.  He is my man.  And you are a smuggler moving a load...
A few more moments still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
And if I were in the Comoros in the Indian Ocean where would you be...?
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
Is this the protective male talk?
Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
Where would I go?
Of course.
Would you find me...?
Whenever.  Maybe later maybe sooner.
When?
Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.
Really?
Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them.  So...at some point you should cash out take your money and run...
'Cause whatever can go wrong will...?
Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
Do I need it?
...to fall back on.  You know a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Why?
Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts?
In Kowloon once I got one that said "Live now because life is dust."
They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
What's the best fortune you ever got?
And the chopsticks and fortune cookies?
I forgot the napkins.
Hola viejo.
Hola chica.
Maybe I'm only one.
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
Twenty-eight-point-five.
Available cash is not an issue for us...
I need thirty.  Calculate in also the cash you don't have to front...
The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it.
And you're our thirty-percent partner?
'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere for any reason it comes up short we make good.  Your operations will from now on run risk-free.
'Cause you don't lose loads?
Zero risk.
Good samba dancing...?
Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why you're thinking, would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
Did Christmas come early this year...?
What do you mean?
Is it December?
Cost less.  That's the point.
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But three per ki was OK for openers.
Like...?
Exactly.
...and therafore there is no consequence?
That's right.
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
You know how improbable this is...?
To mothers.  And all that we owe them...
Died in childbirth having me...
Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?
Okay.  Macon Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know now...it's all business...
I insist.
No.
Tell <u>me</u> everything.
I dance...
Later!  Do you dance?
Mojitas...?
I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want...
How's he not your husband?
Angolan Military.  Went back to the fighting.  Disappeared.  Who knows...?
Your father?
She's dead...
Where's she now?
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali too...  ...those days in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
Were you born in Havana?
I never do business in Cuba.  And nobody goes to Cuba but me.  And he is not my husband...
You do business in Cuba with your husband?
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...
Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
Havana.
The Keys?
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
Where's that?
Bodeguita del Medio.  It's the <u>only</u> place for mojitas...
So where's the best place for mojitas?
Show me...?
It goes very fast.
How fast does that go?
I'm a fiend for mojitas.
What do you like to drink?
And what is that?
There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product...
Nothing.  As in "free gratis."
What's "nothing"?
What's the recovery?  How much are you looking for?
Okay.
We want it back.
Right now.
When?
You do.
I thought we had to meet the Man.
Really?  So what is this a party?
Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
'Cause she will tell you.
Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?
Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She is safe.  To insure that I am keeping her close to me.  It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you.
What friend?
I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
You got something to say José let's hear it.
Hey Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts.
Yeah?
Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
Packaging?
Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load...
He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
What'd Neptune tell you?
How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?
And what do I do with him?
Yeah.
I'll be there.
He tried to..."do business"...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there.
I do.  We don't do business with him...
"Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
Client got delivery.  But there were..."extras" in the back of the truck.
I'm also called "Cochi Loco."  That means "Crazy pig."  'Cause I enforce security and get people to tell me what I need to know.  That part of what I do you never want to find out about.  Other people will negotiate the money and go or not go.  Not me...
Red light green light José?
I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.
You afraid of violence?
Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas you knows you?
What...?
Sit.
Sonny Burnett...this is my partner Rico.
José...
Call the US Coast Guard:  "Come and arrest our ass."  And Switek resumes romancing Miss Ukraine...
What's the point?  It's going down.
What's your take?
And José my ace lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land air and sea.  So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...?
If you see a few new faces don't get jumpy...
I would never doubt you.
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
I am asking.  You to me.
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?"
As in...?
What is going on...?!
We're the ones doing the death- defying shit?  And he wants us to give that up?  For what? A chump-change bust so he can get his picture in <i>The Miami Herald</i> to impress the slug farm in DC...
Chill out Sonny.
Hey fuck him.
So we want to change-up the mission statement.
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
Their loads are poly-drug.  "E" from Holland methamphetamine precursors from Jordan Afghan "H." Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network.
Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow...
And what does that level of spending on first-class private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
Oh that makes it okay then.
We're makin' moves on each other.
You're not makin' a move on her...?
No.
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
No.  Havana Louisiana.  Don't we have a meet?
Havana Cuba...?
It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
Verdado where?
Verdado.
Where?
Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
Where'd you go?
On my way back...
Where the hell are you man?
Nothing.
How much we looking for?
Good.  So let's go...
No.
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
Like...?
You worried about the tree line US Customs AWACS or something else on your mind?
To the limit.
Who knows...
They watching us watching them watching us waiting for them?  Or what?
Five minutes...
What do we got?
Port-Au-Prince.
Where we meeting 'em...?
Nothing.
Anything?
What happened to the last transporter you <u>had</u>?
Then it don't work.
Money thing is done in advance in places where there are no guns. Because when money and guns get together there is violence...
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people not your people.  No tweakers dopers first- timers we don't know.  They didn't do time with us they ain't doing crime with us.
What kind of weight?
And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.
So we can close each other's eyes right now.  Real easy.  Real fast.  But then nobody makes any money...
"No viejo.  That was José Yero splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
People gonna walk into this place and say "Ola hijo!  That some crazy wallpaper.  Whew...it wild! Is that a Jackson Pollack?"
That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time.
And we didn't come down here to audition.  Business auditions for us...  ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us <u>before</u> Nicholas calls.
We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.
So?
It says "We do not fear you."  It says "Fuck off and die."  It says "We get down for recreation..."
Track with me here...  They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But no these guys show anyway and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money...  What does that say to you?
Transpo?  How they bringing the loads in...?
Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  So...
White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park. Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back...
White gangs...?  It doesn't track.
Something's wrong.
Stevens?
Alonzo...
What is it?
Hello Miss Ukraine...
The honey trap.  And there's the honey.
And there's Dmitri...
Skin has to touch skin.  That's the requirement for the warrant.  Then he makes a credible excuse and he stops....  Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security...
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
What's our deal?
If you're down we're down for the play.
Then you should.
If we were for real and knew our shit we'd fade this one...
Switek?
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
Go ahead.
You're giving away your money fool...
Twenty on my man...
Eleven to seven he blows it.
I'm my <u>own</u> man.  And anytime you want to see how much man I am?
Control your men.
Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.
Out of...?
Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.
What are you talking about?
Who's the "we"?  There's you and there's us.  And all we got from you was bad intel.  "Low-level producer."  Yeah right...
Who said "go exploring"?  We want this staying on track.
From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level we think.
Never heard of him.
A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
From whom...?
How do we do that?  Make a buy?  That went well...
Get into business with this crew identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky discover their source how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there...
To recruit you.
So what do you want?
We don't know.
How?
NLR we think.  I wanna know...
OMGs Mongols Nazi Low-Riders prison gangs?
...so there's <u>no</u> industrial- strength HRT weapons team out there tonight?
That's right.
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
Meet and greet.  "I flash you some of mine you flash me some of yours?"
"Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
Guy's involved in a "meet"...
How do I know?  I got the call from Alonzo on an open line.  That is the hand we have been dealt at this moment at eleven-forty-seven o'clock Friday night.  Okay?  I am trying to alert you here.  <u>You</u> know whether or not...you have a thing goin' down.  I do not.  But we know this guy.  I think you know this guy.  Normally he is cool.  Tonight he is distraught. That is atypical.  That engenders foreboding.  Do you understand the meaning of the word "foreboding"? As in badness is happening to <u>your</u> deal right fucking now?
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now he's YOUR informant.  Stevens called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
Okay.  What's up?
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
What's your Miami PD badge number?
Detective Crockett.
This is Agent James Fujima.
Hello?
If they ran the rental car or lease on this place...even if it's EPIC database in El Paso...they'd have to work through the layers of bullshit three weeks deep.  Then they'd find your deeper hidden criminal selves...
How will it stand up?
You're so <u>not</u> the PD if you got busted on a DUI you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school.  San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.  Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again...
Hi Gina.  This is from Frick and Frack. Trudy?
"Hi Gina.  Hi Sonny."
I have faith.  In horoscopes and fortune cookies...
Have faith.
This I gotta see...  ...the "make up an excuse and stop" part.
How do I know?  But it was from the get-go.  Knew the FBI had run me into them.  Sonny I gotta go...!
How'd they get onto you?
Goodbye.
Alonzo...!
...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them Sonny...!
Where are you?
After I check on Francine and the boys then I'm gone.  Sonny tell Rico I'm so sorry.  I wanted you to know...
Alonzo what's goin' on?!
I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're on their own...it's all their deal anyway so fuck 'em.
I don't understand...
They had me from the gate.
Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
It's fucked up.  I'm sorry...
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry Sonny...
On the phone.
Where's Riccardo?
Yeah.
Sonny...?
Yeah...?
He's talking to you bro.  What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...
Who are you talking to?
They got a steady stream of supply. So no...
Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?
But Miami PD wasn't part of the J.I.T.  And from what Alonzo said he didn't give you up.
As in your ass is dead in the water.
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA ATF U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.
C'mon man!
...what else what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
Oh good...
White supremacist types.
Haitian Dominican Russian Israeli?
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
...you are trying to reassure me because you know when people get anxious they make mistakes. You're worried about me.  Do not be.  I am careful.  I am cool.  I got Trudy backup whatever.  You worry about you.  Because you are the ones who are in denied territory not me.  If your focus is on me you'll miss something coming at you.  That's how people slip up. Get hurt.  And I'd die if anything happened.  You worry about <u>you</u>. You and Sonny...are in the dangerous place.  I'm fine...
...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built.  It's quality girl.  We're cool...
...the lease the phones the cars...layers of false ident. Would take the FBI weeks.  How long did it take them?  Three hours? Four?  This means "We can reach out and touch somebody."  Like Bad Teleflora.
Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.
Okay.
"Salutations from the south..."
What's it say?
You mean with the flowers...?
The bouquet here.  Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow.
What flowers?
...and thanks for the flowers.
Okay...see you soon.
Bored.
Nothing.  Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
Yes.  What's up?
You sure?
Yeah.
You okay?
Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
He did volunteer one time...
Only African he ever "relocated" was a $2000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci and he got wounded when she took an NBA draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him...
Switek pulling this off...?  That's not faith; that's delusional...
So?
I like the diminished risk.  It frees up capital reserves.  I like working with self-interested businessmen who are competent.  You can predict their behavior....
What would you do...?
I think José suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people who are good at what they do?  They have egos too...
A good deal like this with us for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust make it while you can.  He's ambitious.
Why?
They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away rather than compromise operational security...that's good.
And...?
But what does your intuition tell you...?
Burnett?  They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida.  It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads.  The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital.
José doesn't like the deal in South Florida...
They've been targeted.  And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
Not French registry?
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
They will kill you.  And then they will kill your wife too.
Meaning...?
It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. José knows that...  Whatever he's going to do he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.
Of course!  That is why I placed myself here with you knowing Yero would pull this crap.
You set this up!
That sonofabitch!
Maritime.  Jose will fill you in.
Conveyance?
"Future" of...?
And as an investment in the future...
Two three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's your end is $6000000.  Complex transshipments or dealing with containers these have front- loaded costs we pickup.  For this kind of weight the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load.  Transactions are offshore.  Dollars or euros.  Secure internet transfers.  We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS to be avoided...  No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on U.S. soil...  That's the deal.
Define small.
I run down the numbers.  Nothing is very negotiable.  Small loads?  We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent.  The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.
You work that out with La Senora.  You will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the Malaysian ship.  For collection in North Miami.  You warehouse it. Release it when we say.  I'm sure you have friends with fast boats...
Importation value?  At twenty-two thousand a ki...
<u>You</u> give <u>yours</u> to me.  <u>We</u> position all the assets hauling our loads...
Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd.
You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again...
I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.
It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
This the load you lost a while back?
Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then piss off back to where you come from...
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
I had to lay eyes on you.
Then what were we talking to you for?
Do we need this...?
What do you care?
Nothing.  'Cause how you do delivery on the beach I don't like.  Maybe this does not work.
And violence is extra.  And expensive.  So how much weight you looking to move?
Slow and low Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite stealthy 1400 nautical-mile range thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...
Equipment?
Nicholas said you okay.  That's nice.  But how I know if you any good?
So lay it out my brother...
They lied.
They said they wouldn't hurt them wouldn't hurt them if...
Alonzo you don't need to go home.
What...?
Alonzo...
I gotta I gotta go...!
The Feeb gig was I front a coupla undercover Russian-speakers to them.  One's ATF.  And broker the deal.  Set up the meet with the NLR types...
What the hell did you do?
He's been like that all day.  Hey Danny you coming?
What is it with Red?  I've never seen him this way.
If Evelyn's here the rest are here!
Are you sure they're here?
No numbnuts die.  You get your nurse alone you look her in the eye and say "Baby they're training me for war and I don't know what'll happen.  But if I die tomorrow I wanna know that we lived all we could tonight."  I've never known it to fail.
What good-lookin' sumbitch?
That's your line for tonight ya know.
You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you EVER die!
You don't forget love Honey.  Not ever.
I wish she could forget him.
No I was.
He was that good?
Now listen it's hands off Billy.  I mean you can put your hands on him if you want to but then my hands will break yours.
Ooo she's thinking of her date!  Come on you've been dating a pilot.  We want to know what we can expect.
We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!
Hide them?  On a date with pilots?  I'm talking about how you make them show!
You mean hiding them?
Do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform?
Yeah.  But if I have to get something out I c-can always s-s-s-  SIIING!
Nervous?
Only when I'm n-n-n-
Do you always stutter?
How would I know.
But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange?
You know the football player Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red cause you know I'm red...and they thought I was strange so you know Red G-Grange Red Str-Strange.
Red...Strange?
He I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.
Not anxious to die Sir anxious to matter.
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed Lieutenant?
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
Good on you then Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
That's me Sir.
On loan from Colonel Doolittle is it?
I wasn't gonna apologize Sir.  I was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again even if it was only for five seconds.
Too late for apologies Walker.
Sir I --
You'll love it.  No base no bars just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
Hale-what?
I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
Sir?
Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
You liked that?
That was a nice little stunt you pulled buzzing the base.
Yes Sir.
You're Walker right?
You guys know her?!  I gotta have an intro!  Man I'd like to --
Rafe's girl Evelyn?
Mai-tai's.  I got this to tell ya about mai-tai's.
Yeah.
What the hell happened to you guys?
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
What lizard?
Where's that lizard?
Hey.  You.  Mr. Coma.
Yeah but he was wearing shoes!
Well you p-puked on his feet.
Shit he's puking on my feet!
You guys are new?
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
No like...
A m-missionary?
Ever hear of mai-tai's?  Comes in a big...pot.  Like...like...
He did.
Who the fuck taught you to fly?
Anthony Red stay with the guns!  Coma you cover the cannons!  Joe Theo come with us!  Earl you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
Danny I don't like this fuckin' guy.
Of the four left only one is full of fuel.
Earl!  You said the planes were ready but -- but what?
You guys get those!  Earl Rafe come with me!
Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
They'll all fly but -- oh shit...
They ready Earl?
Yes you can.
I can't make it.
Danny...
Home of the Brave.
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
We'll get separated over the target but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China.  I'm on your wing.
Broomsticks instead of tail guns.
Longer?  It's getting shorter.
It's not getting any longer.
We'll be loaded with 2000 pounds of bombs and 1500 pounds of fuel.  I got another Chinese phrase for Doolittle. "Mug wump rickshaw mushu pork."  It means "Who the fuck thought up this shit?"
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
It's shorter than our practice runway.
What's between you and her is between you and her.  But here's what's between you and me.  Everybody has a hero Danny. And you're mine.
Maybe just trying to measure up.
Bullshit.  We've played with each other pushed each other.  This is different. Like you want to prove that you're better than me.  Who's that for -- Evelyn?
We've always tried to beat each other.
No.  You're trying to beat me.
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
Danny what the hell are you trying to do out there?
Fun today.  Like old times.
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
I'm out of fuel!
I'm out of ammo!
Home of the brave.
Land of the free.
Little less.
I got a half a tank.  You?
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
You hear my okay?
Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.
They're all over us!
Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.
It's tight.
They're coming around for another pass. You got extra weapons and ammo?
This ain't a little feud Earl it's World War Two!
Six P-40's.
What's there?
Auxiliary field at Haleiwa ten miles north of here.
Where are we going?
Come on!
Get me into a plane!
How sweet.  Is that when you put the move on her?
She said I was so much like you.  I said No I'm not.  I'm like I am because of you but I'm not you not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder.  But you saw the better part of me the part of me that could be like you and changed me. You made me who I am.
She loves you.  I know that.  And part of what she loves in me is how much of you she sees in me.
Fuck you.
Don't blame her Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking.
I guess I'm used to it.  I've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back.
How come you're not pukin'?
How's this for a fact?  I loved her first.
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
So what are you saying?
Yeah right.  Anyway you didn't know.
I was grieving too.
I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead she was grieving you were trying to help her.
What facts are those?
We gotta face some facts here.
If you can't keep up don't drink yours.
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
Waitress!  Four beers!
Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.
I didn't mean it.
Why be sorry?  That's what you feel it's better to come out with it.
Sorry.
Let's go get a drink.  Unless you're scared to talk about it.
Upset?  Why should I be upset?
You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset.
It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come and she comes...then I know she loves me.
Then why are you looking for her?
Yeah.
Didn't you say you told her not to come?
Some other time.  I don't feel like a party.
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
Nah you go on.
Danny you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you or for your mother... or your father with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice Danny.  It's time I made mine.
Don't make this a joke Rafe.  You're talking about war and I know what war does to people.
I'm sorry Danny but they're only accepting the best pilots.
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
The Colonel helped me work it out.
How could you do this?
Hey you wanna test my limits you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!
Didn't you say test the limits?
There's another one!
Home of the brave!
Land of the free...
Good shooting Rafe!
Good shooting Danny!
Kill the bastards!
It's Germans!
Power dive!
Bandits at 2 o'clock.
We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
Yeah.
Who's gonna to that?  Japan is four thousand miles away.  So you guys just arrived huh?
What about easier to hit in an air raid?
The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.
Hey!  What is this the planes all bunched up like that?
Hang on.
So beautiful!
From the air?
Well...sure.
Hey have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
Sorry.
I swore not to talk about him tonight but there's all this stuff I think I ought to tell you that he didn't get a chance to.  Rafe was...he was lonely.  He had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty.  The week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring.
I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
How's everything?
...He said that?
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
You were more like brothers.
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business owned their own planes.  Real straight frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house and I never left.
He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
Before Rafe left he asked me to be the one to tell you if it happened.
Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were. Because he's dead isn't he?  And that's why you've come.
Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.
Y-Yes Sir.
No baseball diamonds Red.
Colonel to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy ya gotta practice.  And to practice it ya gotta play --
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here Gentlemen is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo baseball stadium.
I have a phrase I want you all to memorize:  "Lushu hoo megwa fugi."  It means "I am an American."  In Chinese.
Then wh-where do we land?
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
C-Colonel we been p-practicing takeoff's but I ain't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks.
The navy will get us to within 400 miles of the Japanese coast.  We'll launch off the carriers from there.
And where's the secret base Sir?  The one we t-takeoff from.
I know.
Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane -- then McCawley Walker the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't make it you don't go.
I take it back about the flowers.  We're all gonna die.
I thought I'd made it clear I'm not just putting this mission together -- I'm leading it myself.
I want to introduce a couple of people. Doc White is a flight surgeon; he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission because we can't spare the weight of an extra man.
Bombers.
In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here.
Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots train and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
Well sure Colonel --
You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience so you're volunteering for a mission I've been ordered to put together.  Do you know what top secret is?
Is that the good new Sir or --
Explain what?
We can explain Colonel.
I heard what you did.
Thank you Sir.
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
Thank you Sir.
That's bullshit son.  But it's really good bullshit.
Never Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me Sir working out the transfer I did it to say thanks.  To honor you Sir. What the French call a "homage."
Don't get smart with me son.
How could it be irresponsible Sir if you were the first man in the world to do it?
There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
You too 'Mam.
You take care Dorie.
I left my Mama and joined the Navy to be a man.  They made me a cook -- and not even that really -- I clean up after the other sailors eat.  I shine the officer's shoes.  In two years they've never even let me fire a gun.
Tell me something Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
Thank you 'Mam.
Respect.
What do you get for winning?
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
How often you fight like this?
I'm Evelyn.  And I'm just a nurse.  But I'm not playing golf and that cut needs sewing or else it's gonna make a big lumpy scar.  Whatta ya say?
Dorie Miller 'Mam.
What's your name?
Yes'm.
Win?
Boxin'.
How'd you get this?
Wait let me look at that... You better come in here.
Sorry to trouble you.
Our doctor's gone too.
'Scuse me 'Mam.  All the ship's doctors is golfing and I couldn't find nobody to look at this.
It was.  I couldn't have you go away wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
It must of been a convincing letter.
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle and told him I needed to see you before you go.
What?...
That's what I have to tell you Rafe.  It wasn't a choice.  It --
Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice.
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.
Rafe --
There's nothing you can do here they'll die or they won't we just --
What else can we do?
It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --
Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home lonely good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
It's not your fault Rafe.  The letter I wrote you they --
It's all right.  Danny always said I see things with my emotions instead of my eyes.
I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through but I'm back.
It's been...so different being so sure you were dead.
Nothing that won't heal.  I guess.
I'm just...so amazed so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay aren't you?
I called my folks then Colonel Doolittle.  The Colonel sent a man to pick me up.  They wanted to debrief me. I told the Colonel I needed to see somebody first and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour.  I've done a lot of talking.  You haven't said anything.
...Survive?  I jumped in a patch of fog and nobody could see me.  I hit the water hard.  And it was so...cold.
How did you?...
I saw you I couldn't go in I...just stood there wondering if you knew.  You looked...sad and I had to sit down a minute.
Why were you sitting here instead of...
I sent telegrams I guess the military traffic held them up.
Do one thing for me before you go.
Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I love you.  And I will come back.  I'll find a way.  And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you and every minute since then is real.
I don't know if you can choose that Rafe.
Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable.  What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that.  If I don't come back I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.
I had to tell you in person.  Because there's something else I need to say.
You waited til tonight to tell me?
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
But you're in the U.S. Army how could you --
I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails and If they lose there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there but here.
We're all going away.
There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.
It surprises me that I'm not the only one on this balcony who feels that way.
The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
I was hoping to meet him.
No he...got some news today.  He'll be okay he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
Danny's not coming?
Nice to meet you Betty.
Oh this is Betty.
You too Lieutenant.
Hello Lieutenant.  Good to see you.
And if we fail and lose our carriers we destroy our ability to fight them at all.  As soon as the second wave returns we will withdraw.
If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year!
The second wave has not returned.  And we have no idea where their carriers are. What is the damage report?
We have achieved complete surprise!  The first wave is returning the second is attacking now and we have lost only a few planes.  We can launch a third wave Admiral.
We must go ahead.  This is our moment.
We have a fighter screen up in case we are attacked Admiral.
We have achieved surprise but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
A brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war.
Brilliant Admiral.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
If we achieve surprise they will offer little resistance.
Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
God help them.
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do if any of the planes make it.
So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
There've been some complications Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
Have the planes made it to China?
We have bombed Tokyo Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
We've done studies.  We're confident we would turn them back eventually...after they'd gotten as far as Chicago.
What if the Japanese did invade?
Crank her!
I have'na been able ta --
Fook ya dooble!
Learn English then!
Fook ya!
And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat you better start learning to speak German.
If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States!
All of 'em.
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
The struts are loose the hydraulics are leaking and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
Leapin' Jesus!
The Americans themselves have made it possible.  We will annihilate them in a single attack -- at Pearl Harbor.
You see us as capable of such a blow?
The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
You have something to say Yamamoto?
The time has come to strike!  Or to sit and let the Americans cut off our oil and our future.  I know what you whisper to the others Yamamoto -- that the Americans are strong.  Yet look at their leader.
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
So you join us Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
Seal the cave?
No sir I haven't forgotten.
Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden and chained him to a tree and the children made sport of him.'
A doll alone proves nothing. True. But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit.
To begin with your methods of dating the past are crude to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
I apologize.
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
Indeed the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
We've never meant to be treasonable sir.  But up there in the face of that Cliff is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction you'll hang for high treason.
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
How did you know we'd come here?
Yes sir so it was -- thanks to you. But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written ...
He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was promptly revoked.
Certainly sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.
You know Dr. Maximus our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
Oh. no. sir. I was just assembling my notes.
Did you forget our appointment Cornelius?
Dr. Zaius --
Certainly sir. I'll get my notes and come right over.
Cornelius if you have a moment today I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
Good luck then.
They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science your language whatever knowledge you have.
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
Reconstructing a life. Care to have a look?
What are you doing there?
Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far his position's as good as yours.
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
Taylor I'd rather you -
Shut up.
Taylor you're not in command here. Put down that gun.
If there's any shooting Dr. Zaius you'll be the first to die. Depend on it.
Right now if you like.
When are you going to show me what's in the cave?
No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.
You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.
It empties into a sea some miles from here. That's where the cave is.
Where does the river lead?
I know ... Nevertheless I thank you for saving us. You'll be in trouble for going there.
Sorry Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water no vegetation. Nothing.
Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
It's a long detour to Dead Lake. What would we find?
You still don't believe me do you?
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
As you wish.
Just the same I want one.
The best. But we won't need them.
Do you have any weapons?
Well Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
Right.  Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon.
We'd better get started. If the mounted police pick up our trail they'll come this far at least.
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
How did it go?
Zira....
A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
Zira listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
Oh Cornelius show some strength!
No thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
Well maybe they're not.
Because if he is a missing link it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
'I am not a missing link.'
How can scientific truth be heresy? What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? A mutation. A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape -
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
You didn't think so then.
The evidence was very meager --
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
It's probably wrong --
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
No they won't -
Don't be foolish. If it's true they'll have to accept it.
Zira are you trying to get my head cut off?
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
I don't. And I'm not going to try.
'Then how do you account for me?
No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.
Cornelius why do you insist on provoking him?
And even if it weren't why fly? Where would it get you?
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
And they fell out of the sky with you?
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
Oh Cornelius be quiet.
Now just a minute --
Where did you learn to do this?
Dear you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
It's a stunt. Humans don't write.
Zira come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
The blood transfusion.
Remembers what?
Look -- she remembers.
Watch.  Hello Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
What's so special about him?
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
Neither do I.
No.
Do you have to work tonight?
Blessed are the vegetarians.
Well at least they haven't tried to bite us.
Let's find them all.
Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.
You're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
Taylor -- quit riding him.
None at all.
Any particular reason?
That way.
Which direction?
Okay. If there's no life here we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
No.
Any sign of dangerous ionization?
Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.
Good question.  Landon -- check your communications kit.
But how long is a day?
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
Yo!
Geiger counter?
Yo!
Got your sensors?
They're still dirty. And their bite is septic. Look at that ...
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
Hmph.
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
What do you mean made it? I'm an animal psychologist that's all. We don't have any authority.
But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
These animals are dirty doctor. They stink and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
This place is dirty doctor.
I don't know. This beast lost a lot of blood.
Will he live?
Him.
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
Yes sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
Sustained.
Objection!
Sustained.  Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant.
Very well. I suggest we go and look at them.
That's true Dr. Zaius. My witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater.
Proceed. But don't turn this hearing into a farce.
He can reason? With the Tribunal's permission let me expose this hoax by direct examination.
Directly Mr. President. This wretched man the accused is only a pawn in the conspiracy. We know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture. The State charges that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen experimented on this wounded animal tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster ...
Come to the point Dr. Honorius.
There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle and made him the lord of the planet.
State your case Mr. Prosecutor.
Well Dr. Zira? This is a man is he not?
Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore he has no rights under ape law.
Show this to the President.
Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us Bright Eyes why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
Some apes it seems are more equal than others.
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
I admit I know nothing of your culture.
Tell the court Bright Eyes -- what is the second Article of Faith?
Do as I say.
He's vicious Doctor. Besides it's against the rules.
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
I'll see.
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
What happened?
Well you know what they say. Human see human do.
He's trying to form words.
Huh?
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
Awww it still hurts doesn't it?
Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
You could get hurt doing that Doctor.
No change. The minute you open the door he goes into his act.
Good morning Julius. How's our patient today?
Good morning Dr. Zira.
You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here in six months we'll be running this planet.
We got off at the wrong stop.
Try telling them our names.
No cigar.
Okay.
Can we take a dip?
Let's take a look.
Scarecrows?
I'd like to know why not. You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people. So what did you do? You ran away.
But I'm not prepared to die.
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
Don't bother
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
Oh and one last item. Immortality. You wanted to go on forever.  Well you damn near made it. Except for Dodge and me you've lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead it looks like we're the last of the strain. You got what you wanted kid. How does it taste?
And the glory don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
Climb off me will you!
Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
I'm prepared to die.
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight or you might as well be dead.
All right --
What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
If only we could get a fix.
It's a fact Landon. Buy it. You'll sleep better.
Prove it. If we can't get back it's still just a theory.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
long pause) You know it.
Apart from that you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it huh?
By our time.  You've turned gray.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
You don't seem very cut up about it.
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
Landon! Join the expedition.
We're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.  That could be Bellatrix.
Well? Where are we? Have any notion skipper?
We're here to stay.
Gone.
Forget it. Abandon ship.
It's no use ... there she goes.
To Earth! That we've landed!
What signal?
Landon! Send a last signal.
The flags of discontent. It's the only way anything ever gets changed.  Don't try to follow us.  I'm pretty handy with things like this.
What?
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
I think you're making a mistake.
Lucius.
I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose.
They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
Yes I can do that.
I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
What is it?
All right all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
Disillusioned...  But vindicated! I've been right all along. You can't trust the older generation. It's a matter of values --
Not everything. They left a hostage.  How do you feel Lucius?
Relax. You'll see it all later.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
Sorry Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
In my world -- before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
I'm for that.
Shouldn't we be moving on?
Fine. Just let her out.
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
I want her.
Zira doesn't want your female.
She comes along too.
Come on. Get me out of here.
So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
Who are you?
To scare off humans?
The Hunt Club.
Who put them up?
Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
Gorilla hunters ...
All right...  Get in...hurry.  Put this on.
He wouldn't leave her.
I told you not to bring the other one.
At the very least this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast and determine what's to be done with him.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
We're -- conducting a new experiment.
Why special?
Yes Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
I know it's a man. And you know the rules. No animals outside the compound and most certainly not without a leash.
A man Dr. Maximus.
What is that?
Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And you want to do the same to me!
Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
One is in a museum!
Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
My name is Taylor.
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
Sustain all objections but face the truth!
Sustained.
Let us assume as common sense dictates that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet then surely he sprang from our own. Yes sprang.  As an animal psychologist I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
How so?
Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
This is a joke in very poor taste.
Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal while the apes remained..."
Read it yourself.
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense he asks that this statement be read into the record.
Did we create his mind too? Not only can this man speak. He can write. He can reason.
Mind your tongue madame.
ThatŐs a lie!
Then why is he called the accused Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
Sustained. In all fairness Dr. Zira you must admit the accused is a nonape and therefore has no rights under ape law.
By your leave Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed Dr. Honorius.
Don't look for it Taylor. You may not like what you find.
We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it ages ago.
What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
Why? From the first I've terrified you Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
No thanks. I'll take freedom.
Where else but in a cage does man belong?
Of course you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
Then there is another jungle?
He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet I'd say that was a fair bet.
Then answer this: If ran was superior why didn't he survive?
Cease fire! Withdraw!
Tell him to pull back!
That's lunacy. I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that's equally as inventive as yours. But it would be conjecture not proof.
I don't say he was a man like an Earthman but I'd call him a close relative for he was plagued by most of man's ills.  Yet fragile as he was he came before you -- and was superior to you.
Okay.Up to the cave.
Of course.
Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
Twelve hundred years ago.
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
What is your proposal?
All right let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
Stop right there.
You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I do know who you are Taylor. As I know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone.  You have just six hours to make a full confession. After that I'll employ surgery to obtain one.  Guards!
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
If you are protecting others of your kind it will cost you your identity.
I don't know.
You may well call it upside down since you occupy its lowest level. And deservedly.  The eastern desert has never been explored -- because we've always assumed that no life can exist there.  Save yourself Taylor. Tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone?
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest Taylor? Where are your women?
Then you admit --
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
All right suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
Of course.
That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy doctor.
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
A fort! Unconsciously you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
What about it?
Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
My tribe as you call it lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
You lied. Where is your tribe?
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
However it's within my power to grant You a reprieve.  That is why I summoned you here tonight.  Tell me who and what you really are and where you come from and no veterinary will touch you.
Emasculation to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately a kind of living death.
No.
Oh your case was preordained. In a way you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
What about me?
Identify him then. Speak to him.
With one of them.
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
God bless you.
Go with God Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
All right but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
Dr. Zira I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
It's better than going to prison for heresy.
We can't.
Would you like to come along?
Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
It's humiliating.
Why not?
Taylor please -- don't treat him that way.
Taylor you can't.
Then tell them Dr. Zaius won't leave here alive.
He has a point. On my planet children often play with ape dolls.
Taylor! Tell him.
Except that he's also the Chief Defender of the Faith.
Taylor please --
And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
She's not sick at all.  She's pregnant.
What's the diagnosis doctor? A touch of the sun?
You threw us together remember? And you guessed right. Men like apes get despondent without a mate.
You want her that much?
Maybe not.
Actually you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
Yes.
Are you going to take her with you?
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
Taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.
Listen-
You did this to him! You've removed his frontal lobes!
No I swear -- I never saw this man before.
You! ... You knew about this?
Second from the left.
Which one?
It's him...Landon.
A hearing.
What is this?
Shhhh!
Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?
Dr. Zaius I could have sworn he was answering you!
I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
There! Can you believe it? I looks like he's talking.
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
Listen listen -- I can speak --
Well Bright Eyes is our throat feeling better?
In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.
But the proof? The doll?
He won't survive.  Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes some jungle beast will devour you.
But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
What?
But there's the doll sir.
Secondly if these 'tools' as you call them are unidentified why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
Let them talk Mr President. Let them talk.
Mr. President I believe the Prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes.
He doesn't know.
How sad. Stuffed and mounted eh? Dead men like sunken ships can tell no stories. And his other companion?
Where are they now?
This is his assertion.
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
Like you I find it difficult.
Do you believe him?
I do not state it sir. The prisoner does.
Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
Yes Sir.
Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
But perhaps he understood --
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
He's moving his fingers!
Sir I'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor.  Captain you there?  Hello?  Shit!
No Carter.  The reason I'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to Hong Kong.  And what the hell is Heaven on Earth?
Is it because of the hookers sir?  You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.
I've waited my whole life for this job but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?
Two hundred cops?  Was Mario Sanchez there?  He owes me money.
Do you know what happened yesterday Carter?  I was officially nominated for the Commissioner's post for the LAPD. There was a dinner last night two hundred LAPD officers were there.
Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy you love that shit.
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
Is it true Carter?  Are you in Hong Kong right now?
I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me out!
Winner!  Four winner!
Two-hundred thousand dollars?  Who wants a hundred dollars?
Two-hundred thousand!
How much is that?
Winner six!
Everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips but the black man gets the nickel is that it?  Did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips? Do I look like Chicken George to you?
No sir.
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll is that right?  Are you a racist?
No I just assumed...
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
What the hell is that?
Mr. Tan is not to be disturbed by the help.
Last party all he wanted was Sting -- not one person danced.  Tonight I'm doing Superfreak I don't care what he says.  Where is he?
Wait.
I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet I need to get his requests.
The band has been playing over an hour.
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
Invitation please.
All right Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off the hook.  For now.
I knew it.  The guy's name is Zing.  He works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.
One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. 100%.
What?
Yeah.  We already been there.  This is big Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even tell the difference.
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too didn't you?
So tell me what you know.
You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
How'd you know?
Is this about the funny money?
Look I need some info and I don't have time to play around.
I'd like to see you try.
Jail!?  James you better back off. Badge or no badge I'll kick your ass.
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
James you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude you being little Chang's godfather?
And I got mine meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time I'm closing this place down.
I got my sources.
What??  Where'd you hear that?
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong James.
The real question is where are the plates?  If we can find the plates we can stop the whole operation.
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
In 1959 the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil so for the Shah's birthday the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.
They think I'm a crooked customs agent.
So what's your story?
Look I've been working this case for months now...
We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
Yeah that's right.
How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
You see no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
Your friend's ship?  Oh man.  I must've walked onto the wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work.
I'm sure because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
Called?  What's my ship called?  Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson.
Well I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called?
I don't want to play games with you Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
El Capitan?
That's right.  I'm the owner the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
This is your ship?
I'm sorry you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey I understand.  Make yourself at home Isabella.  Champagne caviar whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
I don't think so.
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
Isabella Molina from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
How you doing baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
C'mon Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won now just put the gun down.
Do you have it in you Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
Lee you okay?
Would you like me to tell you how your father died?
I ain't his partner I'm a tourist.  I got proof.  See I got a mini-bar key.
Could you have your partner wait for us outside?
That's Chief Inspector he got promoted.
It's no problem.  But I must excuse myself inspector.
I'd like to pay you for that laptop.
I don't think so...
Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.
I'm Lee's new muscle his right arm -- and don't let the robe fool you.  This is the only color they had left.  Now get up!
I know you Detective Carter right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?
I said get on your feet!
I'm busy at the moment.
She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take that one too.  How you doin' baby? And...that one in pink.  She can do my feet.
Oh yes she's very nice.
Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.
You pick any girl for you and your friend.
No.  It's my first time.
You get massage from Chinese girl before?
Never leave home without it.  Lee this one's on me.  You save your money.
You bring American money?
That's right.
Oh you American?
You play games with me Detective and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.
You're right you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
Lemme ask you something Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie maybe go listen to some jazz...
Detective Carter you always seem to show up where you don't belong.
Stevie how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture we can use it for a mug shot.
I'm just in town for the weekend taking in the sights.
Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?
Amen to that brother.
I could use a little vacation.
Some Kung-Pao?
A little Mu-shu.
The Plaza Hotel?
First class.
New York City?
I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden.  See the Knicks play.
Come on Lee.  Stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up.  There must be something you want.
This money is evidence.
They owe us man.  That's the least they can do.
It's okay I got lots more.
No Carter.  I can't take this.
About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
What is this?
It's okay.  I can finally let it go.
Your father's badge?  No way man.  I can't take this.
You take care of yourself Lee.
I guess so.  Thank you Carter.
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
Yes.
That your gate down there?
She's going home to New York.  I need some ice.
I saw that.  She kissed you didn't she? You played it cool though.  Walking away never looking back.
No problem.
We made it man.
It's worth it to me.
Lee wait a second.  It's not worth it man.  He's making you do this.
Just GO!
Carter...
You go after Ricky.  I got this.
We have to get to the Penthouse.
What?!?!
Ricky Tan is alive.
Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!
No you didn't!
I did!
Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?
MMMMMM!!!!
Lee!
I'll give it my best shot.
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
I'll go to the craps table make a big scene.  When security comes over you make your move.
Wait a second.  There's guards all over the place.  You'll need a distraction.
No.  I'm going to find out.
Isabella?  Are you crazy man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!
It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room.
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign putting my life on the line and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
Dancing?
Lee what the hell are you doing?
Wait here.  I'll handle this.
Carter...here comes the rich white man.
Buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy. The man has the biggest tits in Asia.
Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell.
Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us.
Couple?  No you got it wrong there's no couple here.  Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.
Follow me my Asian brother.
What is Mac out?
Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
Let's go.
That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
Red Dragon.
Lee.  I just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
Vegas...
Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
You've been a good friend James Carter.
End of the line.
We're slowing down.  This must be it.
Now that I believe.
Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
Benjamin Franklin he discovered electricity.
Who's Benjamin?
Hello Benjamin.
I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box.
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
Very nice.
Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.
They'll probably torture us first shock our privates then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims?
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
Forget it.  It doesn't matter.
Are you serious?
Tell me the truth Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
That's rough man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week I go crazy.
Once in a while steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
Steamed dumplings?
No kung pao chicken.  Never.
What about a little king pao chicken?
No mu-shu.
You're kidding.  No sex?  Nothing?  No mu-shu?
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
How was the sex?
Mind your own business.
If she was the right girl you'd be thinking about her.
No.
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
Fine by me.
I think we should stop talking.
I thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  They don't let everybody in.
What's a Chinese heaven?
Is it the same heaven or is it a Chinese heaven?
Yes.  We have heaven.
I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
Fine.
I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
See you in the next world.
I won't talk to you you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.
Fine with me.
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
Well we're not friends.
We are not partners.  Between your daddy my daddy and the beating I just took as far as I can tell all partners get you is dead.
I'm not used to having a partner.
It doesn't matter.
Why did you help me?
I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you.
Shhh my head hurts.
Look man I'm sorry.  I know you got a thing for her.
For how long?  Face it Lee she's playing both sides.
She saved our lives.
What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
Are you okay?
Snoopy is about six inches taller than you.  I'm sorry Lee you never had a chance.
I am not third world ugly.  Women like me they think I'm cute.  Like Snoopy.
You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall dark and handsome you're third world ugly.
She never even looked at you.
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.
We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong.
Let me see it again?
It's a bomb.
I wouldn't do that!!!
Take it!
Get it out of here!
There's people up here!
Wait!  There's people down there!
I don't need a turn!
It's your turn!
Pick it up!
She's walking back towards the door.
I don't understand?
No I don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone.  Lee she's wired...
What is it?
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh God...please don't let it be a dick.
What?
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.
Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
I don't want to hear this.
Oh sweet glory hallelujah...
What's she doing?
Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
No.  It's not right.
Gimme the binoculars.
She's getting undressed.
What's going on?
I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
Is it hot in here?
Nothing.  I said nothing.
What did you say?
Slow down baby.
I'll try to stay awake.  It's so boring.
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
She's just standing around -- not doing much.
She hated my voice.  Said it drove her crazy.  I sang to her all the time - in bed - in the shower - I thought she liked it.  She finally told me it was driving her crazy.
Excuse me?
No.  It was my singing.
Let me guess she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
It's a long story.
I'm sorry Lee.  Why did she leave you?
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
You pull a muscle or something?
The truth is I haven't had any mu-shu in six months.
Hey I didn't mean to call you pathetic.
Carter there's something I have to tell you.  You were right about what you said in Hong Kong.  All I do is work.  Never take a day off.  It's all I have right now.
Look at her.  Now wake me in an hour I'll take over.
How do you know?
He'll be back soon.
He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
Yeah that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat and she's staying in his suite at his hotel I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?
The same place you find all RichWhiteMen.  Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here try it with a smear.
Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
Yeah what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
You sound like that all the time.
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people when there's shooting they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
How do you know he's our man?
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
Who?
Not bad.  Now every crime somewhere has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
Almost but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
Follow the Rich White Man?
Lee let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...
I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one.
Why LA?
You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy get on the plane.
-- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death I'd go to hell to do it.
You said --
It sounds impossible --
I cannot go to LA...
Come on we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal they bring it first.
What?
So are you getting on the plane or not?!
I know.  I know.  I am sorry.
IT IS CRAZY!
I thought you'd think it was crazy.
You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...
No no that would be crazy --
This is about your Daddy's death?  Hell Lee you know my father died on the job. You could have told me...  This is about more than all that isn't it?  This is about your Daddy's last case right?
All the evidence against him disappeared the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
He found out his partner Tan had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it he was killed in the line of duty.
Ask me if I give a shit.
Five years ago my father was Chief Inspector working a big international smuggling case.
Forget it.
Good at what?
You're not very good at this are you?
No.  She's a school teacher.
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
Don't be talking about my mama.  Or my ass!
Give me your best shot you flat assed mama's boy.
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
What are you gonna do about it grasshopper?
What the hell is going on here?
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
I'm okay you go.
What leave you alone so he can cap you?
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
Who?
Not Yu.  You!
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
You.
Who died?
Carter?
And you ain't black!
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it Lee when was it?  Year of the rat?
I have plenty of dates.
You're pathetic man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off had a date?
It's my job!
My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
Where are you going?
Don't look at my ass!
Goddamn you got a small ass.
I'm calling for back up!
I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
This is a very dangerous man.
That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now shake him down.
Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
What's wrong?
Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
Well hurry up.
She said I could pick any girl I want.
What are you doing?
My friend is on vacation from America. I want to show him a good time.
How you doin'?
Hello.
I am a tourist.
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.
Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
This won't take long.
I'm telling you right now I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.
No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed.
You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
I'm sorry.
You lied to me.
Try to land on your feet.
All I wanted was a little mu-shu.
Shit.  C'mon get up here and help me out.
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
What'd I say?
You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night.
No.  You are a civilian.  In China I am Michael Jackson and you are Toto.
Man are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
Carter you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar?
No we're here for information to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open.
Damn it why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then go ahead pull your badge and do your thing.
I'm sorry.
I knew you were lying.
This is a gangster bar we're here undercover.
Are you kidding they love me.  I'm a star Lee.  A god to these people!
Carter get off that stage!
Bathroom.
Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here so try to blend in.
Take this.  It's a Magnum.  You can fold it in half.
No.
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?
You better take one.  Your breath has been a little funky all day.  Let me look at you.
No.
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
Carter would I lie to you?
Don't be messing with me Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
Of course not.  My Superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  Big party.
Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
Don't be giving me attitude Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation and I want some mu-shu.
You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits Volume Two.
I said that?  Which word was "goat?"
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
All I did was invite them for a drink.
Those girls drove off because of you.
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD.
I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car.
Fine with me.
Stay out of it Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
Hey you Secret Service Man what are you --
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again you got that?
What "revenge" is he talking about?
Quite a night Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.
Now you know.
I didn't know which side you were on.
I'm fine.
Are you okay?
No.  But I'll help you.
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
Dip me!
How do I know I can trust you?
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao but the place burned down before we could move in.
If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
Why don't you go get them?
Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there.
Look over there.  That's the eye in the sky room.
Just trying to make it look real.
You move well.
I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You have to trust me.
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
I need your help.
What's going on?
Excuse me?
Put your arms around me.
Yes.  They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars and there's only one way to spot a fake.
And Hu Li killed him for the plates.
It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year.  Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.
No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard of the Superbill?
Is this a payoff?
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
I know who you are Inspector Lee.
I still have my lunch money from third grade.
Do you still have the bills?
That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  Never shut up.
Baby Duck?
What are you doing hanging out with Baby Duck?
No.  Freddy Ching's in Crenshaw.
The Praying Mantis school in Bejing?
Master Ching taught me.
I'll take him.
Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
Thank you.
Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this.
Did you tell Sterling?
Lee we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to...
Are you okay Lee?
All he wanted was some mu-shu.
The Secret Service?  Why?
Lee this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service.
It's my responsibility.
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case I'll understand.
Any leads?
Lee there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
If you reach for that gun I'm going to kill you.
I don't think it's over.  There are casinos all over this country.  Let me make you a rich man Lee.  Don't make the same mistake he did.
Put the plates down.  It's over.
You're just like your father Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him to share with him but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.
There is a ship in the Hong Kong Harbor...
Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
The police can protect you.
... if your father were alive I would be turning to him now.  I didn't blow up the American Embassy but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death.
Don't.
Despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
You must come with me for questioning.
Lee I've missed you brother.  I heard about the two Americans I'm so sorry you must be under great pressure.
It's a massage parlor downtown.  "Heaven on Earth."  You will find your answers there.
Heaven on Earth?  Master I don't understand.  A temple where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain where Earth reaches for the --
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
I know Master but...
A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.
No.  Your father.  Your father and Ricky Tan were my favorite students... and for such awful things to happen as they did --
Ricky Tan?
He was the best I ever trained you know.
Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.
I need your help Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.
Yes Master.
Didn't I teach you to always arch your back?
Put a diaper on him Chin.  I want to talk to the great Inspector Lee.
That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.
Who the hell is that?
No.  He will report to me.  Do we understand each other?
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation.
This is still Hong Kong.
Chin you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation to provide us with whatever we need.  If you have information it belongs to us.
Times up!
Well I-I hope that--that--
Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
Y-yes--
Does that include Helen Filmore United States congresswoman?
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
Henry what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding?
I don't know--look!  They can get in now man!  We got no one left to guard it!
Is he with the girl?
There isn't anyone! He's opened that whole sector now!
Well get someone down there!
We got trouble.  That bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field--just took out three on the north end!
Listen man I don't need this shit--
I now understand the expression "you get what you pay for!" A bunch of chumps!
I don't know what hit us!  We had them trapped on the stairwell.  They could be anywhere now.
I guess not Cooper...
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
Well Cooper...
Well Filmore--
Rule two:  without alternative use yourself as a shield.
What about rule one:  never let the person you are protecting out of your sight!
You're talking about committing suicide!
Because I'll be firing at them.
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
What are you talking about?
I'm going first.  Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!
There's the fence...
Now what?
Used to Filmore used to.
You're a lot like my father Cooper... you think with your heart.
By the time I got back to the party our ambassador was face-down in a bed of bloody azaleas.
What happened?
I drew my gun ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
Yeah?...
Cooper...
No but you didn't defend him either! Didn't want to rock the boat.  Guess the ride was too smooth. FILMORE I was acting under legal counsel!
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
What do you think?
What's that supposed to mean?
After Leizburg he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
What do you mean?
You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
Forget about it.
What happened!
Let's move it we got company!
Yeah and we don't have much ammo either!
We don't have time!
--be prepared.
We're outta here--
What now?
Who's got matches?
What are we going to do!
Just the soda please. Cooper heads down the hall.  Filmore watches him leave sighs then turns and smiles at the General manager:
Anything else?  Maybe a sandwich?
Look Cooper I don't care what my father says if you embarrass me here you're going to regret it understand?
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
Just get me a coke and don't argue with me OK?
If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
What are you going to do Cooper throw yourself on a Bunsen burner? It's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab.  We'll be out in no time.
I said I'll lead.
Why? Are we going dancing?
I'll lead.
The maintenance hatch--it takes us outside the building!
Where does it lead?
That's it!  Up ahead!
We wouldn't have made it out without you. FILMORE Or without you.
It's nothing to worry about.
How's the arm?
Good...
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
Are the labs in operation?
We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
How well do you know this place?
Even better.
I have a lighter!
I said I don't want any goddammit!
I insist...
I don't want any...
Come on drink up.
Shut up!
You see it paid off--you broke away from the old guard congresswoman.  It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore--
Yes you should.
I suppose...you think I should thank you.
Like where--in your dreams?
I know you're not too happy at this point.  It's too bad we weren't able to meet elsewhere under different circumstances...
It seems to me we are just sailing away. They haven't sunk us yet have they? Besides don't you worry your pretty little head about that.  It's all been taken care of.
You understand that they're watching our every move right now--you think you're just going to sail away?
You got it all backwards Helen--but that's OK you work for the government...
You're going to pay for this...
I hope you don't mind all this--it's just that the networks will eat it up you know...
Hey now!  No cussing on TV!  Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  One is my perky co-anchor here and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!
Go fuck yourself...
I don't know.  If you gave me a reason to...
Are you going to kill us?
Enjoying the tour so far?
You can't think like that!  We're watching them like a hawk--he's bound to trip up make one false move--
She's as good as gone...
Looks like Richter isn't acting alone--he's heading into some dangerous waters.
He's in there...
What about Cooper--where is he?
Chemco's been developing nerve gas?
Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!
We have a special forces squadron out of Thailand surrounding the compound as we speak.
Good.
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
Well?
The transmission is an hour old...
She's still alive.
Came over the satellite.  We're keeping the bird clear should they call back.
They were probably topping off a docked tanker while he stalled for time--without anyone being the wiser...
What!
He wouldn't take it on the helicopters. He'd transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the waterfront...
How much do they have?
Well it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
What the hell is it anyhow?
Apparently this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
Mister Myers it is a chemical plant! There are a number of volatile compounds-- but they are safely stored away...
Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS a cure for cancer?
What do you mean?
So what are we looking at White?
I don't think you--grasp--the situation Mr. Myers.
The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
And what exactly do they intend to do?
I'll let the senator tell you.
Who's Ryan Cooper?
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
And--of course there is the human cost which is incalculable.
Chemco is willing to deal with him meet his demands.  I can have the money there in an hour.
This was taken when Richter was arrested in Washington state 1985. He was charged with interstate arms trafficking skipped bail and has since been a fugitive.
Excellent.
We're almost done piping in directly to the Olympia.  Should have it all in about an hour or so.
What's happening at the waterfront?
You're fucking crazy Richter--you know that?
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.
Where the hell could they have gone!
Excellent...excellent!
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out.
Richter-we got a problem!
Something tells me you don't want to be on TV friend.
I know what I'm here for-you don't need to remind me.
Of course it's codified!  Each number probably corresponds to a compound.  Have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out--that's what you're here for.
I'm in to the directory but they've codified the stockpile--numerically.
Have you broken it yet?  We've got six more heads and that means six more hours.
We're secured.  Takeover team is in position and accounted for.
How goes the roll call?
The thing weighs more than a ton-- you want to roll up your sleeves and try it?!
Get your men to do it!
We can't--it's power driven!
Drop the anchor!
If I don't get power up we are!
Are we adrift--
You know when we reach Kompong Som--
Dissent?
Well there was uh a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
My crew is going to work alongside with your men don't worry--we're a team!
Captain it would be impossible to turn down such a gracious request.
Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
Agreed--let's move it.
I say we head out.
Good.
Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
Our traveler's insurance you know what I mean?
There's enough in one vial...
What does that mean?
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
How much of this shit do they have White!!
Of the separate chemicals--I don't know uh offhand--
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
Just what the hell is he talking about?
No thanks Bev.
Coffee Mike?
Damn.
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson assault the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
How's the print coming?
We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
Hey that's the guy-
Thanks.
f 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But I-
-Where?
There out on a call perhaps I can help you-
Officer Reilly vice.
And you are...?
Where are they?
They're not here.
I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
May I help you?
Hang on.
Just do it.
Aren't you on suspension?
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
Go ahead.
Dispatch this is Reilly.
No excuses just do it!
How the hell do you feel yellow?
When in doubt pull the yellow wire.
What... ?
I don't know.
Which one's which?
Okay one of the caps turns it on the other shuts it down.
Yeah another round thing.
Make up your mind trigger.
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there another cap maybe.
What's wrong?
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No Wait...
Something round two wires ...
Stay to your left.
More metal... sharp edge...
Don't touch that.
Wires... metal cold... something soft...
Close your eyes feel your fingertips. Tell me everything you feel.
Keep talking.
Okay let's go in.
Nothing.
Good now the other side.
He has a timer going as back-up in case we got a hold of the remote.  Okay... first run your fingers along the edges feel for a sensor.
C'mon talk to me! We can do it!
Right.
Talk to me. Let's assess.
What do we do?
Off the scale.
Fuck factor?
You got it.
Glass Eighth Street alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off.
Me too.
No I'd slip out past the hotel district behind Greyhound...
Would you?
Should we head for the Interstate?
Cuz he got the girl now he's leaving town.
How do you know?
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
Driving in circles waiting for-
Where you guys at?
What's up?
Be right back.
Ex-girlfriend?
Congratulations you just built your first ticker.
It's working.
No you're not you just don't understand them. Here do what I tell you.
I terrible with mechanical things.
I guess I didn't realize how much I needed him. He kept me straight. It's been tough every second since.
Your partner?
I know. I was working a drug ring deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew I was out here on the street doped up auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me cleaned me up gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys always assess if only for a second.
Pittsburgh two years ago. Partner died no back-up I was too gung-ho. As usual.
You don't have to talk about it.
What?
How long were you hooked?
I don't know. There's an old saying when in doubt cut the yellow wire.
Which one's which?
One shuts it down one turns arms it.
So cut both.
I don't know it's strange... it's not the best career path but when you get the bug there's nothing you can do about it. See when you beat one of these things... 
Why do you do it?
We've gotta be. In this business you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
You guys seem pretty tight.
Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
Right.
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs devices that may or may not be connected set by one or many nutjobs who may or may not be linked.
Not bad for Bomb squad eh?
`Til we get a better lead.
How long are we going to stay?
Industrial wood oil. Separately any one of these things could lead in several directions but together ...
Nitro-cellulose. What is that some kind of explosive?
Bingo!
Look it's a longshot...
Then it's gotta be here somewhere ...
Yep.
This is where the van was parked.
No ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants then disappear. The worst of the bunch they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage.
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
Typical profile usually losers nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. They like scaring people. That's why they call in their threats. Same mentality as obscene phone callers.
With a little training you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something that'd finish off that alleged car of yours. Heck didn't you ever watch MacGyver?
Just how easy is it to build a... device?
There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall call their name but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
Sounds like terrorist heaven.
Top of my class at West Point thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
Cream of the crop huh? You?
Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
You mentioned something called Redstone.
An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent too. But you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.
I don't know. You tell me?
So what were they doing here?
Then let's go see what they missed.
The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
Drive.
Oh yeah? Prove it.
No you look mister! First you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
Hey look--
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
Where...?
Only once at Redstone.
She's not talking. But she could be. So obviously you've seen one of these devices before?
I.R.A. device. Deadliest class of tickers in existence. Computerized multiple sensors booby traps the works. First showed up in a series of I.R.A. bombings in London couple years ago. One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. The Girl is she Irish?
Don't push it slick.
Anything else I should know?
Treat. We treat devices.
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
Mike Reilly.
By the way I'm Glass. This is T.J. and Pooch.
Be cool around my men they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much it's unattractive.
Now wait just a fucking-
This isn't bumper cars it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us you do it our way understand?
What?
That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
What was-? Why...?
We've got one hour. Are you coming or not?
When you need us you love us when you don't we're shunned by the rest of the department.
What're you talking about?
We can start in the area where the robbery occurred.
Alright let's check it out.
Thanks.
Sorry about that.  That's an inch of the stuff imagine what the whole thing'd do.
What do you mean?
High-grade det cord. This girl either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
Where did you get this?
You the Bomb Squad?
Who the heck're you?
Nothing. Maybe they gave up split town.
Any word?
Exactly my thinking. Except none of the targets can actually be linked to government political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured some not. 
Political.
We work fast enough for you?
You got it.
Bev give `em a call find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area.
"Punks" huh?
Hey matches are a very big thing in our line of work.
Oh shit...
It's from an IRA.
Whadaya mean?
T.J. run a trace on this see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are let's hope they're all talk.
Right.
Call upstairs see what you can find out.
What do you think?
Easy guys.  
Assist? What the hell you know about tickers anyway?
Reilly! He's loaded!
Jesus...
We've created a monster.
Alright!
Meg's lasagna. Good eats Reilly. C'mon.
What do ay say?
A bowling alley.
Lane oil...
Let's face it we all knew it would happen sooner or later. The guy who can build a mousetrap that's better than we are ...
Relax Pooch it's just a ticker it's not personal.
I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register.
Glass what is it?
Unlikely. Probably cash register or something.
Computer device?
Helluva fuck factor.
C4 plastic explosive.
Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.
We've lost brothers too we know what that's like.
Hope you don't mind Captain might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?
Yeah he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
Hey I'm next.
Bev you're the greatest...
We're a bit busy at the moment I'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.
No we're terrorists stay back or we'll blow.
People are dying.
Then why tell me?
He's my brother...
Thank you.
There is a motel downtown near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
Taylor's dead.
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
Who is he?
Cover.  It was suppose to be abandoned buildings y'know. No one was suppose to get hurt. The night you busted us...We were checking to make sure there weren't any vagrants around. Scare them away.
Take him!
Drop it.
Shut up!  Who is this?
Alex please-
What? Nobody I-
Who are you calling sis?
Stay in the truck.
Alex please.
Stay here.
No... No more killing.
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
Why are we stopping here?
Nothing... just tired.
What's the matter?
Security.
What is that?
I know. I warned them.
Alex-
You okay?
I'm sorry detective but you're just not my type.
You were lucky today vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone but just remember I'm watching you.
And what you'll shoot me? Hey don't mistake me for one of your partners I'd like to make retirement in one piece.
You touch me again and--
A ticking bomb...
What the hell was that?
Maybe she knows your old man.
Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
But sir--
You're vice not homicide. Besides you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
I want to work this.
Can it Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose.
I'm filing charges against that mother-
Reilly what're you doing here?
Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
What the hell's going on?
We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.
It's a bluff. The guy's full of crap.
Lab's backed up we're still waiting for it.
What about the ballistics report?
Nothing so far.
Prints?
Time for bed kiddos. Say goodnight.
Mike. No thanks I'm fine.
Still waiting for a miracle. Go ahead.
How're you guys doing?
Insurance?
Unsolved bombings in the last year... Boston New York Philadelphia... but no real match
What kind of bomb was it?
Nitro dash of Semtrex vegetable oil ...
Look it's important.
He is!
Fuck factor ten.
Oh shit...
Shit. We're fucked.
That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.
Awright! How bout you Glass how's that chip shaking?
Fuckin A I think I got two partial prints here!
Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
Good boy Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
I don't know...
Pooch can you move it?
That'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.
Vice... Jesus.
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
Ain't that a shit--
It don't work-
Take your time... one day at a time kid...
Don't talk.
Mike...
Yeah just a nick ...
You okay?
Nah let's just take a look-see.
We're vice I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho we'd best call it in for some back-up.
She wanted to cook me breakfast.
What was it this time?
She didn't work out had to cut her loose.
I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
What are you talking about it's purring like a kitty.
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
No thanks. I got close but it never woulda worked.
One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens you'll wish you had family.
You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately anyway?
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
You don't fish.
Hell I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole or something useful.
So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.
You will one day at a time. I'll be old and grey when it happens...
I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
Next week we work the park.
C'mon it's a quiet night.
Look who's talking old man.
Know what the problem is kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.
That feeling won't last long.
Nice to be here.
He's married he don't even know what a lesbian is.
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
In this crowd? It's gonna be Marlboros Camels and maybe a few Kools.
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
So what're we looking for?
My first undercover assignment. I gotta look good right?
T.J. what're you doing?
You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?
Got it! Ace Match Company Flint Michigan.
IRA - instant retirement account.
A what?
Huh?
Device.
Captain assigned me to assist you.
Vice cop on a homicide?
What?
P.E.T.N ...
It's about this.
Make an appointment.
Quiet!
Reilly Vice. I-
We'll keep him pinned in you guys hurry up!
Reilly what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes-
Pull back. You're only an observer.
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
Reilly what the hell are you-?
You've been at the center of two suspect fatalities and two Police Officer fatalities. I'll need your badge and your weapon.
I know.
Reilly you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
It won't work he'll know it's a trap...
It's our only option.
I promised her she'd be safe.
Glass you're to stand by with your team.
My God you're going to use her aren't you?
Glass sorry about Pooch he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now we're going ahead and-
I didn't. But I had to try.
She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
Yes sir.
But from now on any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it?
Yes sir.
You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
Report on the case so far.
What's this?
I thought I told you--
Sir...
Yes sir.
I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints understand?
Look I saw these guys I can i.d. them.
Goddamit Reilly--
I'll do it.
It's detonation cord for a bomb.
What?
I'll do it.
Take it down to the Bomb Squad Artie-
Sir I--
Reilly what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
Captain...
Please.
What?!
The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.
I would like to use the bathroom --
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
Why?  What's the problem?
Laurie I'll have to ask you to come with me.
Major Adamson I can't seem to get in the door.
The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
We don't really know sir but bluntly our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
As you can see we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the farm belt.
Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course I assume we'd be in the fortified command bunker at the time of the launch order.
What kind of time frame are we talking about?
Well sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
What about our end?
They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.
Washington?
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
Small army from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
No idea who's behind this?
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.
Had a lot of blood in him.
Saw the world that night -- random empty hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
That man then he was the first.  The first you --
We don't know that.
God isn't there to do it.
Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
Why doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
Who is she?  Do you know her?
A whore fucking.
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
Wrong answers?
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
Don't call me that.
Walter --
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING VEIDT?
You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
What's your theory?
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
The bearer of bad news.
Hello Adrian.
Hi Jon.
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
Jon -- for Godšs sake what do you see?
Space and time.  I finally understand Laurie.  I see it all now.
Jon --
Veidtšs complex.
Jon where are we?
The south pole.  Timešs flowing backwards.
Jon -- what??
Itšs very strange.  Timešs flowing backwards . . .
Cured yes.
What -- am I --
Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you -- then do it.
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
I won't do that.
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
You're the only human being I care for.
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
Jon I do not want to hear it.
Please Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six hundred years.
Because you can't I know it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
Because --
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
But you knew that I'd -- die.
I didn't give you cancer Laurie.  Not you not the others.  I don't know what did.
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
Yes I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
That's how time works Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
Well I just you just said -- don't act surprised.
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
Jon does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
You -- you know about me and Dan?
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds for example you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
Jesus Jon I nearly choked to -- where are we --
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.
It will happen Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us can do anything to change it.
Jon no -- I can't --
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye. You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .
Collect me?
I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
. . . And just how would you manage that?
I could stay and go.
Mm hmm.
Would you like me to stay?
Not yet there's plenty of time.
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?
I'm here Laurie.
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
Blake?  Dead?
We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
Your problem Dan is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers and drug dealers and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
Then Išve been a very bad boy and youšll have to spank me.  Christ!  Išm doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
What if youšre wrong??
Išm not.
And what if youšre wrong?
Donšt be obtuse Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past none of this will happen.  We wonšt even be here will we?
I've seen them!  I've seen them in there. 
Adrian -- you've lost it.
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds Daniel other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
What is it?  How does it work?
Gentlemen the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.
Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr. Manhattan.
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
What??
Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked at Gila Flats.
The missing scientists.
Yeah.  See I've been working on a little project.  Top secret of course . . .
Thanks for the offer Adrian.  I'll let you know.
Good.  Be careful Daniel don't let up your guard.  Look I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
She's with me.
I don't know but . . . in the wake of all that's happened I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
Who?
Good night.
You did the right thing Daniel.  Let's stay in touch okay?  Good night.
No.  I just wanted you to --
If he comes here I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
I know I know it's just -- he's back on the street he smells blood.
Us.  You mean the Watchmen.
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know stalking us.
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason won't they -- ?
Wherever we are it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
Dan -- what do we do now?
Everything's changed --
Those cars.  What year is this??
Dan is this -- is this New York??
Where did he go?
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
What was he doing?
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
Welcome back Night Owl.
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
My God!  We bust him out of jail in the middle of a riot and he stops to take a --
I think he's going to the john.
What's he doing?
. . . What??
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's about to end.  I feel like I could save it.
That's because --
No offense Laurie but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
Yes you are.
No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.
The costumes.  Am I right?
What?
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
They're practically on us . . .
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
All right.  Mission accomplished.
They're following us.
Oh Laurie.  Jesus.  No.
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
What the hell -- ?
Okay!
This'd better not be what I think it is.
Don't look.  Turn around.
What are you up to?
God you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.  The thing is I try to remember why we did it and I can't.  Helping people or righting wrongs or trying to save the world . . . I don't know.  It all seems so abstract.
Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.
You and me.
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
Antarctica??
I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
Memory lane.
Enough is enough Daniel.  Where exactly are we?
With any luck the world'll end before we get ours.
I'm an open target Dan.  If you're with me --
Laurie --
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
-- What is it.
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get to trial.
Eight cops?  Oh great.  A jury's gonna love that.
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
. . . What?
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here you pick one.
Old?
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you Daniel you look . . .
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
Sure.  It works.  I mean look at this face Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
Play one.  Educate yourself.
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?
His . . . whatever.
His what?
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight okay?
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I mean if you need some aspirin or --
You're sure?
No screw that.  What you were saying before it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
Laurie wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel thanks but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --
Dan what are you so scared of?  I mean me I've spent all these years keeping Jon together and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad.  I'm finally free to to go out and live my own life and --
Maybe not but why take chances?
They're not following me Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone we're right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the Watchmen.
You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me seeing each other someone might put two and two together . . .
Oh yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
Christ yes I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights I'll tell you . . .  How about you Laurie?
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
Well that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
Of course we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
Damn straight!  We were heroes.
Damn straight.

Okay okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us made other choices.
Fine but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .
Dan are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Sorry it's this thing with Blake.  I mean you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Adrian.  Itšs too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.
Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake and --
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
What caused it?
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
What happened?
Okay let's just . . . thank you.
Sorry Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
SHUT UP Rorschach.
Coward.  Giving up.
Cases leads -- they don't matter Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us it doesn't matter.
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
We're running Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're hightailing it down to Adrian's.
I don't think she's coming with us.
Where's Laurie?
Come on Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
What do you mean frame-up?
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
What new information?
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.  Let's get out of here.
. . . That was quick.
Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind use the back stairs all right?
Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge.  Thought you might want to spread the word.
Rorschach that was a long time ago.  I mean that -- that's just paranoia.
So do I.  So do you.
Human bean juice.  The Comedian is dead.
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.
Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
Hiya pardner.  Long time no see.
My dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better than ever.
-- What?
I can fix it.
Janey will you marry me?
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
We should get back to the lab.  You okay Jon?
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
We should get back --  What?
Anything for science I guess.  Janey there's something --
Jon Osterman you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
Nothing wrong with ketchup.
With lots of ketchup?
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
Isn't it true that you --
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
Did you know he was back on the streets?
No comment.
No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --
Oh sweetheart just a quick one.
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine we agreed.  No questions about the Watchmen.
Thanks no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --
Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?
That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.
Jon??  You mean he's --
Oh I am honey.  You see Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us every living soul in deep deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
I don't know why you've been keeping me here but you're in deep shit --
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Am I free to go?
All right Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
That's it.  This is all a trick isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
What does this mean?  What does it --
I'm terribly sorry.
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
Sit down Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
Then why don't you ask him?!?
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
I don't know their real names!
You're lying Miss Juspeczyk.
I don't know their real names.
Their real names please.
I'm sorry about Blake.
Maybe I'll do that.
Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
I suppose I'm serving my purpose aren't I.  I'll ring for the guards.
What about you?
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy he's content he's doing his work --
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
Stay Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
He's a little farther gone every time.
Please.
I'll take a raincheck Laurie.
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
Don't rub it in.  I live here.
Laurie!  Good to see you.
Adrian.
No no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case Rorschach I got something for you.
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Rorschach you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
You're making a big --
Edgar William Jacobi aka William Edgar Bright a.k.a. Moloch.
I don't know who you are buddy but I swear to God you got the wrong guy.
Before you do that you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
Call off the cat and I'll kill you Veidt.
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
Dr. Manhattan right.  Now if you boys care to join me we'll go save the world.
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
Fate of the world at stake Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad press.
Yeah I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .
What is that ungodly smell?
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
Ever see one of these before?
New information.
You're a jerk-off you know that?
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
No needles huh? What about the acid bath?
On come on X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
You know what they say the only way to change the system is from the inside.
Who says you're the good guys?
Cut the crap X I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
But I hate cops remember? Except for her.
You've kept up your end of the bargain I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on you make a decent agent.
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
Thought you bought the farm down there X. Glad as hell to see you.
We don't have that kinda time boss I don't think Prague's gonna be around much longer. I've gotta go now. I've got a lot of bad guys to kill.
Somebody else makes those decisions not guys like you and me. You've done your job X head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
Kinda funny though isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
Yeah that's right. So now that you know you understand why it's important that we get it back.
Jesus Christ Gibbons this is something we came up with?
Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
Come on Gibbons you can do better then that.
Yes it does.
They retrofitted Ahab with some kind of rocket launcher. They were loading canisters of liquid into it light colored and dark colored in the same tube but separate. Something tells me this it that "classified" stuff you didn't want me to know about. Does the song "Silent Night" mean anything to you?
I'm on the way with a team to relieve you. What's the latest?
Snow covered fortress. Army of bad guys. The usual.
You ain't seen nothing yet.
You're a grungy little phoenix you know that? Keep up the good work.
Thanks.
I'm gonna be en route with a team shortly to relieve you. Just keep the pressure on until the cavalry arrives. And X? You done yourself proud helping those people today.
Hey one miracle at a time. They're on to me now remember?
This is good work X damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
Yeah I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about that?
I know poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace out.
My friend if you're planning on crossing me...
Call me crazy but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations period.
What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick.
We're not after car thieves here.
I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes I got a deal set up you want me to hammer it or not?
One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars!
Buddy you sent me here to get close to their organization that costs money.
If you're trying to push my buttons you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment X.
I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.
Just remember I'll be watching.
Is that all?
Crude and defiant as always Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene.
Up yours.
Fine but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
Yeah I spy or I die.
Wherever you go on the planet I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack?
What's with that "X" on the back of your head? Does that mean you're "extreme"? I've got some news for you Mr. X you're a three time loser. So maybe you should tattoo another couple of X's on your head.
Not bad for a gimp.
You're one sick bastard. A sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission. I think no matter which way I go I'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic. So here's my answer: kiss my ass Hop-along.
If you find out what I want to know and if I'm able to successfully use that information you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not you take a bath.
What do I get out of it?
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty tattooed uncivilized. Your kind of people.
Now I'm the one who's nauseous. So what's the deal? What do you need me for?
That's too bad. I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge.
I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
I'm not interested. I've already got a job.
You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound I need your help.
You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
You've really got me confused Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership courage under fire a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.
Good thing you were there to save the day. Come walk with me.
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
Congratulations you've just graduated at the head of your class.
You know what I hate? It's always the assholes that pass the tests.
You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start Cage. It's nausea.
Is that a fact?
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest you've been abducted. And until I say different you belong to me.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me I'm walking.
Oh I don't know I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
Look at me dude do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Why is that?
..If you're trolling around for narcs man have you got the wrong guy.
Alright Cage you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called few are chosen" that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
A Fed I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
Whether you thought this was for real or not you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you anyway?
Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
Diner huh? Let me tell you what the problem is. I wake up drugged to find what? You've got a "salesman" over here reading a three week old newspaper. He's pulling a 211 with a "trucker" who happens to be packing a cop issue H&K 9mm. I get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note. How's that for twisted logic? How did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before I "walked" in? And if that's true why'd they stop and wait until I woke up to gaffle the money? Then I notice how beefy they both are. Hell even the waitress is cut. All three of them look like they went through the same training program. Ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems. That's how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round off even if I gave him all day. Why?
Looks like a diner.
What is this place?
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
Who the hell are you?
So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that.
Alright do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.
Why not? You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid weren't you?
He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky I say we back his play.  I put him out there Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
If it means getting Silent Night back absolutely.
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons you pulled up a shark this time.
That's exactly why we need them.
They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.
I've seen enough. Turn it off.
But programmable. And expendable.
The scum of the Earth.
The usual prospects. Convicts contract killers murde...
You wanna find out about rats ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside someone new someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
How will you fix it?
We're gonna have to step in Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.
Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called "Ahab". Whatever it is it cost him his life.
What do you have?
Now you're gonna make me enjoy this funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
Alright. You wanna eat through a tube be my guest.
You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
We're on to the game ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'.
We're anti-social. We don't have any friends.
We seen this kind of parachutes before you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here jump out with you guys?
That's some accident hombre. You accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard.
Oh I don't know. It was an accident.
Whatchu doing here?
He gets to be the hero.
Like what?
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
Nothing really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
What do you get if you finish?
Just about anything I want it looks like. This is gonna be tough though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.
What weapons do you have?
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
"Anarchy" 99"?
Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
Kirill the sniper. Looks like a bookworm but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya they called him the "Finger of God". Assassination and weapons.
This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.
Naturally.
Next we got a Siberian redneck Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally he covers prostitution and the drug trade.
You wanna check it out? Come here.
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
Slick graphics huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99" they're the bad guy bosses.
What game is that?
It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
What are you doing?
You can't welch on me now. We had a deal.
I can't believe my mission is finally over. I don't even know what to do with myself.
Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
It has to surface to release the nerve agent right?
It's running three meters down. Twenty knots.
A manual control on a moving torpedo. This day keeps getting better and better.
No it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
You can't talk to it?
He's shut out the communication circuit!
I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
You okay?
Let me.
Toadies right behind.
Go to the water it's that way!
Where'd the damn truck go?!
He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there.
Where's he headed?
Let's do this.
If they launch it I know how to bring it back.
Did you do your homework?
Let me guess they had a big white torpedo with them.
Yorgi and Kirill.
He's a regular humanitarian. And all this time I thought he was just a tool.
Don't you see X? For the betterment of humanity he's going to start World War Three.
What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together trusting each other making plans and we haven't even slept together yet.
When this is over we're just gonna take off the two of us. Take a vacation.
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long one more time won't hurt.
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
Yes I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides I can help you from the inside.
You don't have to do that.
I must be healthy then because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
Aren't you afraid?
We'll have to go after them.
They left. To a fortress in the mountains.
Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world or whatever you said.
We can't leave now. We have to do something.
No now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora Xander?
Petra this ain't about the people that sent us here you know that.
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you mine abandoned me.
Of course it matters. Hey hold on!
It doesn't matter anymore forget it.
Wait a minute whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
Where are we going?
I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on right now.
What are you doing with the Ivans?
I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
Are you alright?
You can't it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway remember?
When can I see you again?
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go before they notice.
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
No I guess I've been no help at all to you.
I'm busted up for you but Jesus what the hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger.
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said a criminal.
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
What's that?
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
No something worse. He says it's a surprise but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
They'll kill you you know they will. Besides there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now.
I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.
Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me I'm not gonna let you down.
That's alright I'll figure something out.
If I go out the back he'll know you've warned me.
Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
It's a long story but yeah more or less.
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
What are you talking about?
They tell me you're an American agent.
So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself how bad to you want out?
A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
The people I know want facts the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
Don't even start. I'll be honest I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
You agree with a lot of what he says don't you.
Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
I'm from L.A.
That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
I'm an information gatherer. You wanna go somewhere and talk about it?
What are you?
Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal.
Go to hell!
The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you hasn't it Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong Petra.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That makes two of us then sweetheart because I ain't buying your bullshit either. You're not like them I can see it in your eyes. So you tell me who's bullshitting who?
Maybe we should start again yes? I know so little about you except that you're not what you say you are.
Hey you're good.
You've got to relax baby you're paranoid.
Bullshit. I see you look at everything study everything ask questions. I know exactly what you're doing. Empty your pockets.
Hey take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
We hung out last night remember?
Who are you?
That right? Why's that?
Don't even bother X man I'm not your type.
Come on don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you.
I don't know who you are or where you come from but I don't like you. You ask too many questions.
I was invited. What's your story?
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished you should go home.
Where are you going?
Did you guys used to date? That's it right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you.
Mind your business.
It's gonna be like that huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
Go to hell.
You do everything Yorgi says?
Yorgi asked me to.
If you got a problem with me why are we dancing?
So cute. He shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife.
Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
My goodness a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
Is she for real? Honey maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
Do you know what a wire transfer is?
I have Japanese buyers who are looking to move a fleet if you have the quality of merchandise they're after. And it's a mil two max.
Ten is hardly worth the effort. We're talking a lousy million five U.S.
Nice place to start don't you think?
The Peace conference...
Viktor! Stay the course.
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
You've been so quiet lately Petra I thought you no longer cared.
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
What was that for?
It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.
What are you doing?
Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
Nothing. He had two days.
I thought that was in detail.
Now that I've given you the overview we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
You're joking right?
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food water recording gear anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather fire retardant and if you give this buckle a sharp pull the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
From the Beastie Boys collection?
Think again that's government property. You have to sign for everything. I've got one more that wasn't on your list.
I think I'll hang on to these.
That one I'm real familiar with.
This is your standard dart gun.
They come in any other styles or colors?
Miniature power cams set in on contact giving you a sure grip on any surface.
Listen to you. Right away sir anything you say sir.
Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you some reject from the Ozzfest.
I stole your beat huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
Back off just go away you klutz. Alright here's the story. The items in these cases belong to me. I designed them built them and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up.
That's would be me.
Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.
You're wrong about that. I'm heading out that door right now.
You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself.
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry X. It was a kick for a while but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability here it is.
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
Of course I'm serious. I bought it didn't I?
You're serious?
I was gonna wait till the islands but...
What...?
Well if you're bailing I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
It's not about the money X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore I need some stability.
Alright so I'll get more.
French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
I don't wanna go mersh you know that. But hey if this is about money...
You have all this talent and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no you've got too much "integrity" for that.
I'm having fun what's the problem?
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs all with no health insurance... It's insane I can't take it anymore.
I can see that. Why?
I'm through Xander.
Hey you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
They came and found me. They said they'd kill me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal. These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor.
Why you dogging me up?
Oh come on don't feel bad. You got played so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
What's the deal?
Sorry "dude".
Is this what you're looking for?
I found something big enough for us to take these guys down with. They've got a of nerve agent they're gonna unleash.
You killed me remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
Dude what are you doing here?
Yeah thanks a lot.
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
The corner. Anarchy 99.
Nice hops.
First of all you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two I don't wanna be here either so just step off. Three if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now so just ease up on the machismo bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out I'm gonna get some rest.
You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair a Czech affair that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
Here we go again.
My name is Slovo Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction you take my orders you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience I'll shoot you.
I've been on a plane for twelve hours I think I'll stand.
Sit down.
Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
It's like you said every man for himself.
Help me with this guy.
He's a pretty good actor though.
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
Heads up man. What's this thing on my back?
Been to any good diners lately?
What's so damn funny?
Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day the dawning of a new age of --
Come on Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you man? I thought you'd get it.
And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
Sure if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
Including rape pillage murder.
Easier than that buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London Cairo Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules no law everybody free to do what they want.
So all by yourself you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
You think I'm after money? I told you my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
What's the gimmick Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.
Not bad man not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away my friend? Did you miss us that much?
Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
That was for Anders.
You want to insult me? This is my hospitality. Pick one.
That's alright I'm kinda tired.
I've got meetings this afternoon I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.
My old man he bought into the system and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me I don't believe in nothing I can't see and touch.
Connections and politics it's the same everywhere.
Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit so he was sure he'd get his name cleared but it didn't happen.
You an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
I've been here before when I was a kid. My old man was in the service we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
It's a beautiful town Prague. It's been good to me.
You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss.
How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
You got it man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living man.
"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
To us it means no walls no speed limits no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom but if you think you're free..."
That's what I'm talking about man! That's why Anarchy 99 was born.
Screw the world. If I'm gonna die for something it better be bitches and money.
You wanna see my politics?
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99 when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
What's "Anarchy 99"?
Total chaos man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
Had to do what I had to do.
I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!
Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of.
He's not with us Xander. He must be with you.
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
What's going on my friend?
This is a gift. From me to you.
What's this?
Of course.
I had to inspect the merchandise first.
I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...
Very nice. I'm impressed.
It'll work faster if I have an account number.
Don't look at me X she handles all the details.
Ferrari's Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
When else are you gonna do it?
I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.
I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em who does?
Sorry man don't know what you're talking about.
Thanks but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars expensive ones. A lot of them.
I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. Whatever you want the rest of the night consider it on the house.
He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
Who you workin' for? What do you do for a living dickhead?
This pizda? Never seen him before.
That's the guy.
