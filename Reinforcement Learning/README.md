# Reinforcement Learning

This module covers topics of dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. The materials contain introduction to reinforcement learning concepts, such as Markov chains, state-action space exploration, Q-learning, etc. Materials are supplemented with notebook examples to demonstrate how RL algorithms work. OpenAI Gym is used as primary environment for the course.

# Outline (part 1)

* Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

* Markov Chains

* Exploration vs. Exploitation

* Gridworld example

* Cartpole example.

# Outline (part 2)

* Challenges of RL

* Metrics of efficiency

* Procgen introduction

* Proximal Policy Optimization

# <a name="Project"></a> Project

Students will attempt to train RL agent using procedural generation (Procgen) environment. The obtained results will be compared with performance of human player.
