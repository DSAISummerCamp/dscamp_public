# Working with Colab

This directory contains general information about Google Colab, as well as a notebook, `Mounting_Drive_and_Cloning_Repository.ipynb`, which is an excellent starting point.  

The first section walks you through setup, while the second provides some additional references to Google Colab.

3. Select 'Mounting_Drive_and_Cloning_Repository.ipynb' from the search window and open in Colab.

5. Log on to [https://drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com).  You should see a new folder called `dscamp`, and within that folder should be a copy of this repository.
6. You can open any of the notebooks in the folder by Right Click -> Open With... -> Google Colabratory.  You may need to click "OK" to connect to Colab the first time.
