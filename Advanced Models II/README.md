# Introduction to Neural Networks

This module introduces the basic concepts of artificial neural networks and the powerful software used to train them.  The material contains conceptual and simple mathematical foundations for neural networks, and examples and investigations using TensorFlow/Keras in the Python programming language.

# Outline

* Convolutional Neural Networks. Introduces the concepts behind convolutional neural networks, and important structure in many computer vision applications.  Students will train convolutional networks to predict the ages of the individuals in the photographs on [thisnetworkdoesnotexist](thisnetworkdoesnotexist.pythonanywhere.com).

* Tree Based Models. Introduces concepts of tree models (e.g. CART, Random Forest, xgBoost)



# Project

Students will train a neural network as a Santa Claus detector.  After training, the network will be able to evalute an image as either a picture of Santa, or not.
