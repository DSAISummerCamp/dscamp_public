# Project: GAN 2

Step 1 (45 mins): open the "GAN for summer camp.pptx" and go over the PPT with students. 

Step 2 (25 mins): open the "example 1.ipynb" by google colab. Go over the codes and ask the students to run the codes end-to-end. 

Step 3 (45 mins): share the "GAN_example 2 (for students).ipynb" , and ask the students to fill the gaps in the codes and run the codes. Share the correct code "GAN_example 2 (for instructor).ipynb" with students and pre-trained weights with students, and ask them to have a end-to-end run. 

Step 4 (25 mins): share the "style transfer" example, and share the youtube vedios on page 28 of "GAN for summer camp.pptx". And discuss with students what happens when our computers get smarter than we are?
